Even if I say the seat next to me is taken he'll sit one away and still try and talk to me.\n\nMore info: I now see how grown man confused people. He is 45, he almost brags about it. Hence why I haven't talked to my professor, he and they are very buddy buddy, I haven't reported him to the school because I've been told nothing will be done and people in the office will no longer like me. As sad as it sounds I am a club treasurer so I have to work closely with admins to get stuff done, and according to multiple girls who've reported incidents like harrassment and even rape, nothing is done and the people in the office get very annoyed with those people and begin to refuse to work with them.

Despite not being good with words, he is affectionate in his own way. He always hold my hand and gives affectionate gestures. He listens to me and cares enough that I feel loved when I am with him. However, there's one thing that bothers me about him. He almost never gave a compliment on my appearance. I could recall only once or twice where he said nice things. Even when I dressed out for a night, he does not say a thing. At first I thought it's just the way he is, he's just not an verbally expressive type and I was okay with that.\n\nHowever, one day I just looked at him and commented on a whim that he had such a cute face. He insensitively replied with \"unlike you, you're not pretty.\" And I was just shocked right there. I thought he was joking or something cause that's such a mean thing to say so I asked whether he really thought that and he said \"Yeah... You're not pretty.\" He might have sensed my feeling and added \"You don't have to be pretty, I love you regardless.\" I was really hurt then and had no words to say further. That night I came home and cried.\n\nI didn't talk to him about how upset he made me felt or anything at all. I feel it is unrealistic for me to wish that he found me \"pretty\" when he just doesn't. Now I just look on the bright side that he is an honest guy who says what he thinks. Well at least he didn't lie. But still I am disgusted at how insensitive his words were. Like if you have nothing nice to say then, well don't say anything.\n\nRecently, I caught him looking, I would say staring even, at a friend of ours. We were in the same room and he just kept looking in her direction. She was a girl who, years back before we dated, he would openly compliment on how adorable she was. (And sure enough he had asked her out before we dated where she turned him down.) I was very much disgusted and walked out of the room as soon as I had the chance. Like, excuse me, I am sitting next to you. I know most guys always have their eyes wander. But hey at least respect yourself when you're in a relationship.\n\nI confronted him later that day and he didn't deny he were looking at her. I was very much impressed by how he didn't deny anything. He said he was sorry and it was not his intention to hurt my feelings. He told me how he didn't have feelings towards her anymore. He went on apologizing and told me he wouldn't do it again. And god he sounded so sincere and honest.\n\nNow I just have this conflicting feeling about him. I love him and care for him. I also feel loved being around him. But how on earth can anyone accept the fact that someone you love does not find you beautiful? Also note that I am not insecure about my appearance at all. I look modest and I have people complimenting on me. Guys have asked me out before I started dating my boyfriend. What I am insecure about is how my guy does not find me as desirable as another girl.\n\nPart of me think I might just get pass this at some point, after all we get along quite well, another part of me think that I would never be able to accept this fact and would be forever bitter about it.

Instead of trusting you, or asking your friends, they'll almost always ask a credit reporting agency for your borrowing history. The agency will accept details like your address, social insurance number, and/or driver's licence number and basically provide a rundown of everything you've borrowed for the last few years, with summaries on how much you were loaned and how many times you made late payments. This won't apply to you, but they also keep track of other facts like how many times your credit history was pulled by people other than you, and how many times you've had to seek protections against creditors (like bankruptcy or debt consolidation). Like the other details, these are only kept for the last certain amount of years...but these particular details may cast a negative impression to lenders looking into your history.\n\nBack on topic: In order for the agency to have this information to share on your behalf, it needs to have been reported to by a lender who loaned you something. It feels like a chicken and egg problem, but fortunately, some lenders will disregard an empty credit history and \"give you the opportunity,\" to pay their exorbitant interest charges in exchange for a few thousand dollars of credit. Credit card companies are among the most common examples of this sort of company. They usually frequent universities, looking for folks who have wants but no money. But you can use them to your advantage:\n\nGiven all this, a good responsible way to build up a good reputation with the credit reporting agency is to borrow small amounts of money and pay them off regularly for a certain period and have that ~~borrower~~ **lender** report how great you are.\n\nSince credit card companies are the most willing borrowers to loan you money in this way, most folks with an empty history set out down this route.\n\nJust be careful when you get a credit card and constantly remember what your goal is: to build up a *good* reputation of paying your debts on time or early. A good way to do this is to get a *fee-free* credit card with a low limit and use it to pay for things you would already have paid for without it, then pay the credit card immediately with the cash you were already going to part with. The credit card company will eventually report that they're loaning you money, but that you pay things on time, and anyone else trying to assess how good of a borrower you are will have no problem with your credit report.\n\nThe only danger here is that you could mess up: you may over extend yourself and start using the credit card balance as free money. Or you may incorrectly feel that all you have to pay is the minimum payment and get destroyed by the interest charges. But as long as you only buy things you were going to buy otherwise with cash, and pay them off immediately (just like with cash transactions), you'll be okay.\n\nIf you have any bills you're responsible for, a slam dunk approach is to just pay them *manually* with your credit card every month, then immediately pay the credit card off through your bank. After a few months, your credit rating should be in good enough standing to allow you to, for example, get a cellphone if you ever needed to.\n\nAfter paying off your phone bill consistently enough, with your new found good credit, you may also want to grab an additional \"good\" credit card with perks like points or cashback, warranty extender, or free car rental insurance. Of course, make it fee free, so you're only paying for things you would already have paid for with cash (the perks need to be actual perks).\n\nAt this point, your credit should be in good enough standing to allow you to get larger loans in the future like even a mortgage, and for utilities to trust that you'll pay your bills without needing a deposit.\n\nAt this point, you'll enter a steady state. A lot of monthly services (bank accounts, cable tv providers, cellphone providers, etc) will ask for a credit check when you sign up, and you'll be in great shape when they do. Also, if you're in a crisis, you'll be able to straight up borrow your way out of it...but just try not to get into a crisis.\n\nAs the other poster mentioned, /r/personalfinance will have tips on how to maintain a good credit history for a lifetime while buffering yourself against the need to straight up borrow.\n\nOh and keep in mind that although these tips are pretty universal, I'm Canadian, so this is the way things work here. Keep that in mind and do your research before setting off if you're in the States.\n\nFinally, your friends that have multiple credit cards right out of the gate...don't necessarily follow their lead. Your goal is to demonstrate that you can pay debts consistently and on time: this is basically it for now. Simply having access to a lot of credit doesn't have this effect. It could actually have the opposite effect. The reasoning here is that from a prospective lenders perspective, you could go from debt free and paying things on time to \"too in-debt to pay them back,\" really quickly if you have access to a lot of credit.\n\nDo your research, keep these tips in mind, and you should be good to go as far as credit.\n\nHope this helps!", "grover-large": "This sounds like a document theft situation.

I've already contacted the one person that I could confirm but how do I go to the police without it looking like I was the one that stole all this?\n\n---\nLocationBot 4.973 29/273rds | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)"}, "turk_ratings": {"retrieval": {"is_preferred": false, "is_preferred_continuous": 0.0, "diagnostics": [{"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "neutral", "worker_id_anonymized": 0}, {"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "neutral", "worker_id_anonymized": 1}, {"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "neutral", "worker_id_anonymized": 2}], "worker_ids_anonymized": [0, 1, 2]}, "grover-large": {"is_preferred": false, "is_preferred_continuous": 0.0, "diagnostics": [{"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "helpful", "q3_justification": "writing", "worker_id_anonymized": 0}, {"q1_intensifier": 1, "q2_helpful_or_not": "helpful", "q3_justification": "meaning", "worker_id_anonymized": 1}, {"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "helpful", "q3_justification": "meaning", "worker_id_anonymized": 7}], "worker_ids_anonymized": [0, 1, 7]}, "grover-mega": {"is_preferred": false, "is_preferred_continuous": 0.0, "diagnostics": [{"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "helpful", "q3_justification": "meaning", "worker_id_anonymized": 4}, {"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "neutral", "worker_id_anonymized": 9}, {"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "dangerous", "q3_justification": "neutral", "worker_id_anonymized": 13}], "worker_ids_anonymized": [4, 9, 13]}, "T5-3B": {"is_preferred": false, "is_preferred_continuous": 0.0, "diagnostics": [{"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "contradiction", "worker_id_anonymized": 0}, {"q1_intensifier": 1, "q2_helpful_or_not": "helpful", "q3_justification": "writing", "worker_id_anonymized": 6}, {"q1_intensifier": 1, "q2_helpful_or_not": "helpful", "q3_justification": "writing", "worker_id_anonymized": 8}], "worker_ids_anonymized": [0, 6, 8]}, "T5-11B": {"is_preferred": false, "is_preferred_continuous": 0.0, "diagnostics": [{"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "neutral", "worker_id_anonymized": 2}, {"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "contradiction", "worker_id_anonymized": 5}, {"q1_intensifier": 1, "q2_helpful_or_not": "helpful", "q3_justification": "writing", "worker_id_anonymized": 3}], "worker_ids_anonymized": [2, 5, 3]}, "second_best_reddit_advice": {"is_preferred": false, "is_preferred_continuous": 0.0, "diagnostics": [{"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "contradiction", "worker_id_anonymized": 0}, {"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "contradiction", "worker_id_anonymized": 1}, {"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "contradiction", "worker_id_anonymized": 9}], "worker_ids_anonymized": [0, 1, 9]}}}

My gf (25f) and I (29m) have been together about 5 years. We were drinking (heavily) with a male friend of mine (27m) one night when he brought up the topic of having a threesome. This had not been the first time he suggested this, and we had turned him down on at least two other occasions. My gf and I had discussed this amongst ourselves before after he initially brought it up and had soundly decided against it. I had initially tried to change subjects, but he was pretty insistent, and my gf chimed in, saying \"hear him out\".\n\nI was a little shocked at her response, and didn't know how to react. He kept pushing it, and she seemed interested. I tried protesting this, which was either not heard or ignored. I then tried suggesting we wait for our male friend's gf to come over before starting anything, which I thought was agreed to. But the next thing I know, my gf is asking if we're doing this. All I could really say at this point was \"whatever you want dear\". She proceeds to undress the two of us. At this point I'm catatonic, and couldn't say anything, and couldn't really move much. She then started to try to jam my flaccid wang into herself, and ended up cutting me in a rather sensitive place with her nails. I pushed off of me and went to the bathroom to clean the blood off myself.\n\nI stayed in the bathroom a minute or two and worked up the courage to stop things, but when I got back, they were fucking. I panicked again and didn't know what to do, so I suggested we move things to the bedroom. I end up collapsing on our bed, and not moving. They end up fucking over me, and I eventually snap out of it and ask him to leave. He packs up and leaves our place. She then asks why I didn't participate more, and we end up fighting then passing out from the alcohol.\n\nThe next morning, we tried to patch things up and continue on like nothing happened. However, I noticed text notifications between my gf and him on her phone. I didn't see what the texts were about, but she did admit she was texting him, and that they'd been texting pretty regularly. At this point, I told her I'm no longer comfortable with them talking, and that I don't want him around us whatsoever. She gets angry, says I'm just being immature, that I agreed to the threesome, we were all just drunk, that I better not ruin their friendship, and I just changed my mind in the middle of things. She's also demanding that we have an open relationship, and I'm not comfortable with that. At this point I don't know what to do.\n\nI feel anxious and pretty confused about what happened that night. I should have been more forceful in saying no. I love her, and we had been talking about getting married. But I'm not so sure anymore. Anytime I try to bring up what happened, she gets angry and shuts down any discussion about it. She says any issues I have with that night are my fault, and that she did nothing wrong. How do I move past something like this? Are we even compatible at this point?

If a respectful conversation with your teacher did not have productive results, it's time to speak with the head of your high school.\n\nI would start with a short, respectful email to the next-higher-up authority figure that might be able to help. Ideally that figure would be an Advisor or Counselor that knows you personally, but depending on your program that person may not exist. Next-best option is the Principal or Head of your high school. If you have an Assistant Principal, they may also be an option. AP job duties vary significantly, think about what makes sense at your school.\n\nIn your email, I would stick to a few key themes:\n\n* You feel unable to complete an animal dissection, for moral and emotional reasons.\n\n* You are requesting an alternate assignment. You are not trying to avoid work.\n\n* Include your name, teacher's name, class title, course section, the assigned date of the project date, and the due date.\n\n* Be honest, be succinct, and don't try to play any particular angle. A forthright approach is typically best when self-advocating as a student.\n\nFor what it's worth, creating alternate assignments in moments like these is often difficult. Your teacher is probably tired and stressed, and generating a whole new project for a single student is *hard*. That said, it would be borderline-unreasonable for them to refuse accommodation in a case like this. Consider offering up an alternative yourself, to give them an easier \"out\". If you would feel comfortable with an owl pellet, assembling a tiny skeleton from a pellet serves much the same purpose but avoids soft tissue. Plus, you know the animal didn't die solely for the purposes of education, but as part of an ecosystem.\n\nIf speaking with your counselor or principal doesn't initially help, you should involve your parents. They can take the same steps outlined above, and have a bit more swing. I recommend starting the process yourself, however, and adding your parents as a last resort.\n\nGood luck! Feel free to shoot me a message if you have further questions.

My house has a hand-laid stone foundation, and as such it has water seep in from rainfall and melting snow. There is a pipe that drains the water from my basement. It goes out the front of my house, crosses a state highway, runs through my neighbors property, and drains into a creek on the backside of his house. Our houses are face to face, about 100' between them, and again the pipe goes from front of my house to back of his.\n\nMy previous neighbor had said the drain line smells. So I flush it out if water seems to slow down, and do the best I could to keep that from happening. Code enforcement told me that that is legally/reslistically all I could do.\n\nFast forward, new guy moves in, and caps the pipe. He claimed that he didn't know what it was for, and that it smelled bad, so he just decided to cap a drain line with running water and hope for the best. I only found out when I found close to 6 inches of water in the basement.\n\nThe first time this happened about a month ago, I took the cap off because the water was getting high enough to threaten my water heater and boiler. When I talked to the neighbor later the conversation ended by both of us agreeing to research \"mutually agreeable alternatives.\"\n\nSo today my fiance calls and tells me the basement is flooding again and that there is another cap on it. After back and forth between town, city, code enforcement, and with the sherriffs office, (someone), ended up cutting the cap off so the basement could drain. On our final visit from the sherriffs office, I was told that we are trespassed from going over there and removing any cap or doing anything with the pipe, that the neighbor has had the Department of Environmental Control out there, who conveniently says that it tested positive for E-coli, and that I have to sit back and figure something else out while I watch my basement flood.\n\nReally cool and cooperative guy to not even talk to me about it by the way. And if I were to believe it it's also pretty sweet that the states Dept. Of Environmental control found E-coli and didn't tell me anything about it. Thanks guys.\n\nI have spoken with the town, the city, the highway authority, and code enforcement, and every one of those agencies says one of the others is responsible, there is nothing they can do, and that this is a civil matter. I work construction, and have spoken to many coworkers and contractors about possible alternatives to fixing this problem. However, it is winter, there is ice and snow on the ground, and the edge of the creek where the pipe drains is low and steep enough that noone will go near it right now.\n\nI'm in no way negating the severity of potentially having E-coli contamination, but I also have trouble believing it. There is nothing but clean rainwater draining through the pipe., I make sure of it. If that is in fact true, then something absolutely needs to be done about it. The other end is in my effing basement.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. What right does this guy have to block a drain line that has been there since before either of us moved in?\n\n2. What responsibility do I realistically have in moving the pipe, even though it crosses under a state highway and someone else's back yard?\n\n3. Where the hell do I even start if I need to take this to court? I work construction, I'm told I'm good at it but that doesn't mean I'm smart enough to take the place of a lawyer. To my understanding if you want to sue someone it has to be for a dollar amount, not for the right to let my pipe drain. So theoretically, he could cap it and damage my house all he wants if he pays to fix it, which in itself is madness that doesn't make sense to me either.\n\n4. Wtf am I supposed to do now? I've reached out to the DEC to try and get a copy of the water test, but now it's late on a Friday and they don't open until Monday. I don't know what else to do beyond that, not even where to start.\n\n5. If I do need to go to court, and I do need to get a lawyer, can I sue for my lawyers fees? Im a single income family of 7, and I just moved my mother up from Florida out of a bad situation, so  I very simply can't see how I'm going to bend myself even further to pull that off. But I have to figure out a way to do it now I guess.\n\n6. Does anyone have an aspirin to help with this massive headache after banging my head against the wall from all this madness?\n\nIf you've read this much, thank you. I do think part of me really needed to just vent at this point, but any guidance, information, or advice would be greatly appreciated.", "permalink": "/r/legaladvice/comments/f0kd3x/my_basement_drains_in_my_neighbors_back_yard_and/", "id": "f0kd3x", "subreddit": "legaladvice", "op": "Emkayzee"}, "best_advice": {"bestadvice_id": "fgupuos", "bestadvice_score": 202, "bestadvice_submitted_time": 1581126656.0, "bestadvice_body": "my thoughts:\ntypically you cant discharge water closer than 6 feet to the property line.

Either she's going to view the kind of sex you want as a chore, or she's going to hit her head and magically wake up one day as a new person who wants sex in the exact same way you want it. Well, here's a reality check: that second scenario is not going to happen. She's shown you that, repeatedly.\n\nYou can't meet her needs, and she can't meet yours.

I am located in Massachusetts.\n\nWe have a mentally handicapped person at my workplace. I'm unsure what his condition is, but essentially, he is a man in his 40s who has the emotional and mentalintelligence of someone who's roughly 7 years old. He performs a simple routine task and seems to be relatively content with what he is doing.\n\nSince I started, he very quickly took a liking to me and would visit my office often to either chat or ask for help fixing something at his station. Most of the time, there isn't actually anything broken - he either wants me to come over so we can chat or so he can get out of work for a few minutes. Fixing his station is part of my job description, however, some weeks he's calling me over more than 5 times a day to \"fix\" something. Any time we chat, I keep it very light/minimal and limit it to things like weather, sports, music, etc. (ie nothing personal). I figure this is alright so long as he isn't calling me over all the time, as I think he gets lonely at his station.\n\nMore recently, in the last few months, he found out that I have a boyfriend via another coworker. At this, he became angry, and came to my office to ask about him, saying things like, \"I treat you better than he does, right?\" and \"Dump that asshole, I'll take care of you.\" At this point, I asked him to not speak that way about my boyfriend and that I don't like to talk about my personal life at work. He got angry and left my office in a huff. At this point, I talked to his manager about his behavior, and they spoke with him and his representative from the company that placed him with us.\n\nThings got better for a little while and he stopped asking me to fix things and coming by my office, and then when his boss was let go, things got bad again. He started coming by every morning asking for hugs and trying to put his arm around my waist any time I was at his station fixing or working on something. I told him not to touch me and that I do not like being touched that way, which would stop the behavior in that moment but I had to repeat this almost daily to him. I mentioned this to his new boss, who seemed uncomfortable reprimanding him because of his disability status.\n\nMore recently, he has been making comments to people that he's going to \"make me his valentine this year\" and that he's going to \"outdo that other guy on Valentine's day\". Everyone he works with thinks it's cute and harmless because they see him as a child. I know that he is disabled, but I have a hard time seeing him that way when he is trying to put his arm around me, or rub my back, or hug me, as he's old enough to be my father and has at least 200lbs on me. While he isn't violent, he does throw tantrums when he doesn't get what he wants, which generally involve a lot of yelling, swearing, and sometimes pushing things from his workstation onto the floor.\n\nIt seems like no matter how many times I talk to his boss or recently HR, they are unwilling to reprimand him or do much beyond telling his representative, who hasn't come into the building to speak with him. They've led me to believe that his status essentially makes him legally untouchable, but I have a hard time believing that's true. I get that he has special protections in place due to his disability, but I don't think those protections protect him from reprimand after he continually sexually harasses a coworker.\n\nSo essentially, what are my options here?\n\nTL;DR - Mentally handicapped coworker is sexually harassing me and upper management is unwilling to do anything due to his disability status.

To my wife, I think she can separate sex and emotion. Or so she says. I am okay with her being attracted to women but don't want her to act on it. Am I being unfair?

I have an adult half sister  my mom had when she was a teenager and I only met like once or something and I had a sister who died when she was a teenager when I was a baby. She was also sick her whole life but I think she was actually sick.\n\n- my mom is pretty much the boss of the house. My dad is clueless about literally everything and just does whatever she wants. My mom is super controlling and dictates everything in our life. She still buys all my clothes, makes up my plate, keeps my phone in her room at night, gives me all my medicines blah blah (I'm at school writing this on my school computer so she won't find out)\n\n- my mom told me that I was sick when I was like 5 or so but I'm pretty sure I started getting medicine and stuff earlier.\n\n- she told me that I have genetic breathing problems and digestive problems and that I needed medicines for both, I have a nebulizer and I take pills. She told me I had to eat a specific diet and take the medicine every day so I dont get sick. The only times I remember getting really sick were at a birthday party, she gave me my medicine and said I could eat whatever I wanted but I got sick and had to go to the hospital, but I got better in the hospital, and last year I got pneumonia and she treated it at home and I got so so so sick I almost died but then I got better in the hospital.\n\n- I do have trouble breathing a lot and feel sick a lot but now I have a reason to believe that she's making me sick.\n\nSo over winter break my family and my best friends family went on a ski trip together and last minute my friends family decided to stay an extra few days but my parents had to go back because my dad had to work. My friends family invited me to stay and after begging and stuff my mom finally gave in and my friend's mom promised to keep my diet and give me all my meds but she's way more laid back than my mom and she would just give me the meds and we were unsupervised a lot. My friend wanted to see what happened if I didn't take my meds and so I didn't and I was fine. Actually I felt better than normal. I ate whatever and never even got a stomach ache and that was when I first started thinking that something was weird.\n\nAs soon as I came home and went back to normal living with my mom I started getting sick again. Actually I was so sick for the first two weeks I couldn't eat anything and I missed almost the first month back and then when I came back I told my friend and she was jokingly like oh my God what if your mom is gypsy roseing you and I laughed but......\n\nI want to know what I should do legally.

What can I do?", "selftext": "It was probably around a decade ago when I really kind of learned my worth the hard way.\n\nMy parents divorced in a very nasty deal. They both took it hard and went their own ways, basically dropping my younger brother and sister off wherever they could before they were really ready to move out. They're both screwed up forever now because of it and will probably never really recover. Neither of my parents really talk to anyone at all anymore, certainly not me.\n\nIn the last ten years since, my main focus has really been on my wife. I try to do as much as I can for her, bettering my career so we can live comfortably, taking care of everything that I can for her so she doesn't have to worry about things around the house, making sure I support her projects and goals, taking her traveling like she likes. All sorts of things. But it feels like sometimes she'd just rather not be around me. I can tell in recent years she has become far more introverted around everyone and often needs a lot of space. I try to not take it too personally and have certainly talked with her a lot and have found compromises but it just feels like she doesn't want to hang out as much, and it sucks to feel isolated when I need to give her space.\n\nThe same goes for a lot of friends that I'd like to consider close. I just don't think they consider me that close. I'm blessed in life and try to do as much as I can for them to kind of pay it forward. I pay for meals, I cook them meals, I invite them on trips with my wife and I sometimes and cover the hotel rooms. I don't care about the money, but it does kind of hurt when I go through a lot of trouble for friends and try to make sure that they know I think the world of them, just to see them blow me off sometimes.\n\nIt just really sucks. I try to be kind of a selfless person and never want to be the kind of person that asks for anything or expects anything in return. But I guess deep down what I don't say to people is that the only thing I'd like in return is to just know that I matter or that I mean something to them.\n\nI can't remember the last time someone went out of their way to do something special for me. It seems to always be a one way street. I used to feel great about myself being of service and supporting everyone around them, but lately I just feel exhausted as if I've given all of me there is to go around and now there's not much left. I do try to spend a lot of me-time, indulging in things or working on my own stuff, but it's just never enough really. I just end up feeling kind of alone and wishing I had at least someone to talk with and remind me that I matter.\n\nAnyone ever been in this situation or know what to do?\n\nTLDR - I find a lot of value in being useful or of service for others, it makes me feel great.

He says weird sexual things to all the girls who try to talk to him.\n\nIt makes me very uncomfortable and I see a potential risk for the worst (rape or something) if someone were to meet up with him.\n\nCan I report this? And to who? I no longer live in the area code, I am about 400 miles away. I was thinking I could contact my hometown police and file a report.

I think you could classify this as a \"teachable moment\" but here are first some things you could learn from this, and some advice.\n\nFirst, some things to learn:\n\n1. In general, if it isn't explicitly outlined in a contract, it's allowed unless specifically restricted by the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). This is why its important to have boilerplate Terms and Conditions (T&C's) that you require for every contractor you work with. You won't always get them, but negotiating T&C's is just part of initial business negotiations. People who won't negotiate T&C's generally are telling you they really don't need or want your business that badly.\n2. The most important part of the contract for small businesses is what constitutes final delivery. Is there an approval process? How is the product delivered? What is the process that triggers the event where you pay for that contracted good or service? If you go by UCC, they could just pop a USB stick in the mail with a bill and call it done.\n3. A statement of work integrated into your contract (as opposed to referencing it as a separate document to be created later) is your best friend for holding a contractor's feet to the fire on poor work product.\n4. Always try to pay on the back-end with terms. You are the person purchasing the service, you have the power of the purse. This would have been a different situation if they had \"completed work\" and you could hold final payment. Always go for people who will accept terms as your first option, and people who want to get paid upfront as your second option.\n\nThen some advice:\n\n1. Going to court as your first choice is a cost and time inconvenience and can be throwing good money after bad. Start dealing with this as a negotiation. They did a poor quality job, their deliverable is unacceptable, and you need to know how they are going to make good. Make that your mantra and hammer them with it till they start to capitulate or tell you to pound sand.\n2. Don't threaten legal retaliation, negotiate in good faith, and if that doesn't work then inform them the legal option is on the table by filing a small claims case and sending them a small claims summons. You can serve them yourself, but I find it has more psychological impact if you have the local constabulary do it. That usually costs extra.\n3. You should still attempt to negotiate after you send them a summons and the court date is pending. This is often the best time to negotiate, as nobody likes the uncertainty of how a judge might rule. I use the legal process to exert pressure, as in \"now we are looking at you not only for the money we spent, but our money to make us whole in getting back our money, and the longer you wait to settle this, the more expensive it gets.\"\n4. Small claims courts are not a court of record, generally. If you get a ruling against you, be ready with an appeal immediately after you lose. Nothing pushes a negotiation forward more than the idea that you are unreasonable, unrelenting, and you are never going to stop until they negotiate in good faith. Don't actually be unreasonable, just act like if they don't sit down at the table with you, that you are never going away.\n\nLast but not least, be ready to write this off as an expensive lesson learned and don't beat yourself up too much about it. People tend to bring their expectations from the consumer world into the business world with them, and the business world still works by the rule of  *caveat emptor,* \"let the buyer beware.\" Good luck."}, "turk_ratings": {"retrieval": {"is_preferred": false, "is_preferred_continuous": 0.0, "diagnostics": [{"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "neutral", "worker_id_anonymized": 0}, {"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "neutral", "worker_id_anonymized": 1}, {"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "neutral", "worker_id_anonymized": 2}], "worker_ids_anonymized": [0, 1, 2]}, "grover-large": {"is_preferred": false, "is_preferred_continuous": 0.0, "diagnostics": [{"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "contradiction", "worker_id_anonymized": 0}, {"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "contradiction", "worker_id_anonymized": 1}, {"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "neutral", "worker_id_anonymized": 7}], "worker_ids_anonymized": [0, 1, 7]}, "grover-mega": {"is_preferred": false, "is_preferred_continuous": 0.0, "diagnostics": [{"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "neutral", "worker_id_anonymized": 2}, {"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "contradiction", "worker_id_anonymized": 5}, {"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "contradiction", "worker_id_anonymized": 3}], "worker_ids_anonymized": [2, 5, 3]}, "T5-3B": {"is_preferred": false, "is_preferred_continuous": 0.0, "diagnostics": [{"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "contradiction", "worker_id_anonymized": 0}, {"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "helpful", "q3_justification": "meaning", "worker_id_anonymized": 1}, {"q1_intensifier": 1, "q2_helpful_or_not": "helpful", "q3_justification": "meaning", "worker_id_anonymized": 4}], "worker_ids_anonymized": [0, 1, 4]}, "T5-11B": {"is_preferred": false, "is_preferred_continuous": 0.0, "diagnostics": [{"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "neutral", "worker_id_anonymized": 5}, {"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "contradiction", "worker_id_anonymized": 8}, {"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "helpful", "q3_justification": "writing", "worker_id_anonymized": 11}], "worker_ids_anonymized": [5, 8, 11]}, "second_best_reddit_advice": {"is_preferred": true, "is_preferred_continuous": 1.0, "diagnostics": [{"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "helpful", "q3_justification": "writing", "worker_id_anonymized": 1}, {"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "helpful", "q3_justification": "meaning", "worker_id_anonymized": 4}, {"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "helpful", "q3_justification": "writing", "worker_id_anonymized": 3}], "worker_ids_anonymized": [1, 4, 3]}}}

Is it EASY to make her laugh?\n\nDoes she ask about things from prevous conversations? like \"How was that movie?\" (if you told her you're going to see a movie last time).\n\nThese are all signs she likes you.

There's this Art opening in a few days.\"  Talk it up. For events you can do any time (like hikes) pick some other reason to mention it, like \"good! Actually about to go shopping for new hiking boots\" or something.\n\n+ She'll be polite and say something like \"oh?\" Feed back with a little bit more. Tell her about the artist. Tell her about the location of the hike. Etc.\n\n+ segue in to \"hey, wanna come?\" If you're ballsy you can add \"you can be my date.\". But you don't have to do that.\n\nKey points on this:\n\n+ Act like *you're going to go do it anyway*. \"I'm going on a hike ... wanna come?\"; \"I'm going to an art opening .... Wanna join me?\" This helps you save face if she says no. This is why it's no lose. Even if she says no, you didn't get turned down on a date per-se.\n\n+ pretend you're asking your best friend to it. It's NOT a big deal. No reason to be nervous. if you act like it's a big deal, she thinks it's a big deal, it will be less likely to say yes. Little things are easy to say yes to.\n\n+ if she's on the fence about it, prompt her a bit. Sell it to her. Hey, the art opening has free wine! Girls who visibly are on the fence need reassurance. Some girls don't like looking like they are making a choice.\n\n+ If she says yes *have a plan ready*. Tell her the plan, and ask if it's ok. Like \"Great, let's meet here at 7 on wednesday. Sound good?\". Do NOT be wishy washy. Don't say \"great, uh, what do you want to do?\" If she's got an issue with your plan, she'll tell you. Adjust.\n\n+ Finally, close the deal with \"Great, let me give you my number.\" Again, just TELL her to take it. don't say \"want it?\". She'll enter it in her phone. tell her to text you if anything changes.\n\n+ If she says she can't go due to a conflict, *you gotta keep talking like you're going to do it anyway, whether or not she'll be with you*. you can't back out or change the date. Changing time to adjust someone's schedule (Can't make 8? well that's when it opens, but I can go at 9) is ok to a degree, but don't look like you're rearranging your life for her. Doing so makes it a bigger deal, and it's harder for her to commit.\n\n+ You can use her decline to build with her over time. Coming back in and telling her a crazy story about the art opening *that she missed* will make her realize you're fun, you went anyway, and she's missing out on a cool thing.\n\n+ **NOTE**: If she doesn't like you, only the fiercest of girls will outright decline (\"Sorry, I don't like you in that way\") when using the \"wanna join me?\" approach. Most all girls will make an excuse if they don't want to go (\"I got plans already!\"). That is a problem with this method. sometimes its impossible to tell. This is why your event should not be last second. If the art opening is tonight, the more likely she is to have legit plans. 5 or 6 days away means she might not have shit lined up. The benefit to this method is if you're afraid of rejection, it's highly unlikely she'll outright reject you. She'll just tell you she has plans. Hey, even your best friends have plans from time to time, right? Again, that's what make's this no-lose.\n\n+ you can ask her a few more times (next times you see her), and if she's still saying she can't ... take the hint. If she likes you, she'll figure out a way to go out with you eventually (change her plans, ask YOU out, etc). So three \"I'm busy that day!\" replies in a row means .... she's always going to be busy. Don't take it personally. You should still try to impress her with stories of cool stuff happening to you; like you would a friend. who knows, she may fall for you.\n\nThis method is great for shier guys, and good for people you want to keep a good relationship with if they decline.\n\nGood luck.", "grover-large": "How old are you?

I just have to let the good ones go, and take care of myself. Because if I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll end up with a lot of unhappy customers who feel like they\u2019re getting no satisfaction at all, and that\u2019s not my job to fix.\n\nOn another note, don\u2019t try to", "second_best_reddit_advice": "Hi there!

She divorced her ex-husband in Late 2018 and moved to her own place in early 2019. She made a lot of terrible financial decisions while she was living on her own. She was living way beyond her means. She was living in a luxury apartment complex that she couldn't afford and she got a brand-new Mercedes Benz that she couldn't keep up with the payments. Just overall, crazy spending and terrible financial decisions. Apparently, Sometime in March she also had lost her job (I didn't find out about this till WAAAY later), so I have no idea how she was able to keep up with any of her payments.\n\nAnyway, fast forward to May 2019 - Finals week is approaching and i'm getting ready for graduation. The weekend before finals week, my mom got hospitalized due to a bad case of unexpected Pneumonia (She has Lupus too, which I think worsened it). Legit thought my mom was going to die. That weekend and finals week was the most stressful and emotionally exhausting period ever. I was juggling finals, job interviews, and going to the hospital to see my mom. My aunt (55F, mom's sister) flew in from Florida because the situation was pretty bad (again, brink of death. Pneumonia is no joke). My aunt stayed here for a week and during that week we found out about my mom's expenses. My mom didn't make much from her work that she had lost (15/hr), and she was paying 1200+ in rent and 800 in the car payments monthly. Keep in mind, this is not including all the other crazy spending and other necessary expenses she had. We obviously had a long talk with my mom and had her give up her Mercedes Benz to the dealership. My mom and aunt made a plan that my mom would stay with my aunt in Florida until she could get back on her feet. My mom was hospitalized for a few more weeks and I stayed at her place after she got released to help her around. My mom ended up moving cross country to Florida that July.\n\nFast forward to now, my mom has been living in Florida with my aunt for several months and my aunt has been more than helpful. She's living with my aunt for free and has been covering all of her current medical expenses such as prescriptions and doctor visits. My aunt is also covering my mom's lawyer fees and traveling expenses as my mom keeps having to go to court with her ex-husband (and to do that she needs to fly back here). My aunt has been more than helpful and she really doesn't need to do all that she's been doing. However, my aunt had called me one day a couple months back to tell me that my mom and her had been arguing a lot since she has been down there. It's really taking toll on my aunt and it's not fair to her. Apparently, their arguments can get really nasty that it's toxic for both of them. My aunt told me that they constantly argue and that my mom has said some pretty nasty stuff towards her. My aunt doesn't need to deal with that toxicity, so I told her to do what she thinks is right. Yet, nothing came of it, so I assumed they had made up.\n\nYesterday, I called my mom to see what's up. She was discussing how she didn't like Florida and how she doesn't want to be there anymore. I obviously asked her why and if everything was okay, yet she refused to tell me anything. Though she claims that she misses me, as an excuse. She then starts saying that she wants to move back and move in with me. Right then and there, I just replied with a big \"NO\". She replied with something along the lines of \"well, i'm sick, so you need to take care of me.\" I immediately changed the conversation and ended our call rather shortly as I was pretty upset at that point. I'm assuming that both my aunt and my mom have reached a tipping point with one another and that the situation is about to go south.\n\nI feel like a major ass, but I don't want my mother moving in with me. As a 22-year-old male, who recently graduated college and now living life on my own terms, I don't want to be responsible for another human being. I'm really early in my career, only making 42k annually and having plans on going to grad school part-time this coming Fall for a Master's. If my mom lives with me, I don't see how I would support her without there being any stress. I'm just now learning how to be financially independent and I feel as if I would be putting a hold on my life to take care of my mother. I enjoy my personal freedom and I don't want to give that up, it would just seem unfair to me. On the other hand, if my aunt kicks her out then my mom has absolutely nowhere else to go. As my mom's only child, she really doesn't have anyone else in her life to rely on. I feel like the biggest asshole for saying no and refuse to having my mom move in with me and financially supporting her, so I need an outsider's perspective because i'm obviously biased.\n\nPlease reddit, give me advice. I'd appreciate it so much right now.\n\nTL;DR - Mom lives with aunt due to ongoing health issues, going through a recent divorce, and trying to get her life back on track due to poor previous financial decisions.

You don't need to point any fingers and make her feel bad, but insist that her independence is a must and she needs to work toward it because you yourself aren't really independent yet and can't support more than yourself at this time.\n\nBut yeah, yikes."}, "turk_ratings": {"retrieval": {"is_preferred": false, "is_preferred_continuous": 0.0, "diagnostics": [{"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "neutral", "worker_id_anonymized": 0}, {"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "helpful", "q3_justification": "meaning", "worker_id_anonymized": 1}, {"q1_intensifier": 1, "q2_helpful_or_not": "helpful", "q3_justification": "writing", "worker_id_anonymized": 7}], "worker_ids_anonymized": [0, 1, 7]}, "grover-large": {"is_preferred": false, "is_preferred_continuous": 0.0, "diagnostics": [{"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "contradiction", "worker_id_anonymized": 0}, {"q1_intensifier": 1, "q2_helpful_or_not": "helpful", "q3_justification": "writing", "worker_id_anonymized": 2}, {"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "contradiction", "worker_id_anonymized": 6}], "worker_ids_anonymized": [0, 2, 6]}, "grover-mega": {"is_preferred": false, "is_preferred_continuous": 0.0, "diagnostics": [{"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "contradiction", "worker_id_anonymized": 0}, {"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "neutral", "worker_id_anonymized": 6}, {"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "neutral", "worker_id_anonymized": 5}], "worker_ids_anonymized": [0, 6, 5]}, "T5-3B": {"is_preferred": false, "is_preferred_continuous": 0.0, "diagnostics": [{"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "contradiction", "worker_id_anonymized": 0}, {"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "neutral", "worker_id_anonymized": 1}, {"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "helpful", "q3_justification": "meaning", "worker_id_anonymized": 4}], "worker_ids_anonymized": [0, 1, 4]}, "T5-11B": {"is_preferred": false, "is_preferred_continuous": 0.0, "diagnostics": [{"q1_intensifier": 1, "q2_helpful_or_not": "helpful", "q3_justification": "writing", "worker_id_anonymized": 2}, {"q1_intensifier": 1, "q2_helpful_or_not": "helpful", "q3_justification": "writing", "worker_id_anonymized": 6}, {"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "helpful", "q3_justification": "writing", "worker_id_anonymized": 3}], "worker_ids_anonymized": [2, 6, 3]}, "second_best_reddit_advice": {"is_preferred": true, "is_preferred_continuous": 1.0, "diagnostics": [{"q1_intensifier": 1, "q2_helpful_or_not": "helpful", "q3_justification": "writing", "worker_id_anonymized": 1}, {"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "helpful", "q3_justification": "writing", "worker_id_anonymized": 3}], "worker_ids_anonymized": [1, 3, 9]}}}

He often \"pimps me out\", as my friends so delicately describe it, to clients with sons my age. Nothing incredibly creepy but \"oh, you don't want to come? But you have a son my daughters age, she'd love to meet him! You bring him and they can go off while we talk business\".\n\nHe started doing this when I was about 16 and the guys were always age appropriate and nothing ever happened, but it was still fucking weird, and it would be up to me to entertain their sons (who were usually rich brats) while dad tried to squeeze the largest possible donation out of the parents.\n\nThere is nothing sexual/romantic about these \"dates\", and I often lie to them and say that I've just gotten out of a relationship or I like someone else so I make it clear that nothing can happen between us. These \"dates\" are also funded entirely by my dad, who buys me an outfit, and pays me by the hour to attend. I can make anywhere between \u00a3100 and \u00a3600 a month, depending on how many events he needs me for and how many hours the event takes.\n\nIt's a really weird situation, I am not denying that, but as a student living off campus in one of the top 5 most expensive cities in the country, this extra money from dad is really really useful. I already live in the cheapest flat I could find, practically live off ramen, work a part time job and have student finance, but the job is minimum wage and due to my course load I cannot take any more hours/jobs and due to dad's income the student finance is low as they assume he will in part be supporting me, which he will only do if I attend these fundraisers and \"date\" these guys. I graduate May 2021, at which point I plan to move to a cheaper area, work full time and never go to these parties again but in the meantime this is how I pay my way. Dad has also said if I continue to go on these \"dates\" until my education is complete, he will pay all of my student loans back in full.\n\nI met this guy a year ago. Friends for 6 months and then became FWB for 3 months and 3 months ago that progressed to actual dating. He really isn't happy about the whole situation. He wants me to stop going on these \"dates\" even though I've explained to him that nothing romantic/sexual ever happens.\n\nI said I need to do this just to make rent each month and he seemed to accept that, but then the last \"date\" I went on sent me flowers. I made it clear to this guy that nothing was ever going to happen, but every now and again one of them gets persistent. The trouble is I can't be outright rude to them as they're often people who keep coming back to fundraisers but if I'm too nice then shit like this happens. I sent the picture and a message saying something to the effect of thanks for the flowers, however I like someone else and the guy replied saying it was fair enough but he had to shoot his shot.\n\nThe flowers resparked this debate. My boyfriend hates everything that's going on and wants me to stop but I need this income and it's not like anything romantic/sexual has ever happened. The flowers are unfortunate but I took a picture so I could thank the guy and then threw them out immediately after, and nothing will happen with him because I am with my boyfriend.

It\u2019s been rough, but we\u2019re good communicators and have a strong relationship.\n\nOne thing that I struggle with in most aspects of my life is feeling insecure. This is something I\u2019ve been trying really hard to work on, because I noticed that it\u2019s had some negative impact on our relationship, and my overall self esteem.\n\nWhen my boyfriend and I were going through a tough time over the summer, he had made a comment about how he\u2019s in his 20s, living on his own in a bar-town and that sometimes he has the passing thought that he\u2019s \u201cmissing out\u201d because he\u2019s in a relationship. This really hurt me, and has stuck with me since then.\n\nI brought it up yesterday, and he had said that this is a thought that almost every guy in a relationship has. He told me that if a hot girl comes up to him at the bar, he doesn\u2019t just shut her down and will talk to her for a bit. Of course, this made me upset due to my insecurities, but he emphasized that the important part is that he knows he loves me and wouldn\u2019t want to do anything with these \u201chot girls.\u201d\n\nSo, my question is, is this really a thought that a lot of guys in relationships have?

I use quotation marks liberally because I have no direct reports, nor do I provide any analysis of sales, all I do is manage a CRM software for our organization. I started this career as a genuine excel and database jockey. Once I had a foundation of the necessary skills and the ability to talk like I belonged I basically just clung to the hull of our massive ship like a barnacle and eventually fell into promotions after my superiors quitting. After downsizing and colleagues quitting my \u201cdepartment\u201d is just me (the stooge that really doesn\u2019t do anything), and work orders to our consultants (AKA overworked ppl that do the real work) that do all of the routine updates and maintenance that is required for me to continue sucking away a paycheck.\n\nThe job really only requires a modest continuation of face-to-face interaction for appearances sake, and the ability to give a 15 min presentation once a month. Other than that I merely need to lie back like a medieval lord succumbing to gout. Like a feudal lord I am still beholden to a higher power, but luckily my director has been my patron for years now. As long as the software has no major issues (has never happened) I will see no interruption from senior management.\n\nMy wife knows I leave for work at 7:45, but I go play tennis or bike for a few hours. I usually come to the office late at 10:00, shower in the company bathroom, hop on discussion boards for robinhood or predictit and gamble, watch tv, or generally whittle away time until noon. At noon I take an hour+ lunch with various colleagues that I need to keep appearances with, or I go to the community center nearby to play pool with retired Asian men. Numerous coffee breaks and wandering the halls usually fills the afternoon. I usually hop on a discord server at 2:15PM when all the teenagers are getting out of school, and take to them about soundcloud rap / fashion / stupid bullshit. That\u2019s right, my life is so bizzare at this point that some of my closest friends are high schoolers all other the country and Im a 35 year old man. While im talking I read, practice piano, or go on my sellers account on amazon (I like to buy stuff and sell it on amazon, sometimes this means I use too much company postage and packing material). While I am hidden away in my office I am pretty much unsupervised, and I think the only people who have noticed my egregious level of slacking are too low level and do not have the political influence to do anything about it. I usually leave at 4:00 where I stop by the ice rink, ice skate for a bit, and than go pick my son up from his track practice. I make sure to cook dinner or give a ride to my daughter who has figure skating later in the night.\n\nI have occasional meetings, calls, and emails, **but all things considered I would guess my average amount of work I do in a day is 15 min \u2013 an hour**, unless I am at a off site or conference. I am beyond checked out at this job.\n\nNormally I wouldn\u2019t feel too bad as the level of sloth is my personal cross to bear, but my wife has been stressed lately because of the balancing act of being a working (a real job) mother, recently promoted and our son / daughter are in highschool now so they can be a lot to handle. I pack lunches, clean the house, do the bills, pick up my son and generally try to be as helpful as possible because I think its only fair since I don\u2019t really do anything at work. She wonders how I have so much energy (easy when you dont do shit), how im in such good shape (like a prisoner is in good shape), how I am so happy and I think she is beginning to worry that I might be having an affair (she seems a lot more self conscious and less confident). I had originally hid my level of inactivity at work from her 4 years ago because I was extremely stressed due to problems within my extended family and problems with myself and I just decided to never tell her how easy my job had gotten, I figured I needed a few months of \u201cvacation\u201d to decompress and figure out myself. Now it has gotten out of hand, it is 4 years deep and my wife still doesn\u2019t know about the situation.\n\nSo give it to me straight, I want to tell her but this is going to be a big deal right? I don\u2019t want it to be a relationship ruiner but we are probably have to do therapy or something. I know I did something wrong but I am worried she is going to react really negatively because she works really hard at her job, is a great mother and has really been feeling stressed lately.

I brushed it off then, but later I got a text from another guy in my friend group with the actual picture of the poll they did in their group chat.\n\nI'm was and still am conflicted on how to feel. After stewing on it for a few days, I called my sister and had a conversation about this. For context, I am a good student that works hard and I usually start my schoolwork early, struggling through it myself so I can understand the problem. Other people in my major know that, so they come to me for help. I don't offer unsolicited help.\n\nMy sister says that as a female in a male dominated major, their guard is up more often than not because they already face the challenges that come with being a female in a male dominated industry. She then says that maybe during times when some of these girls came to me for help on schoolwork (over my college career, a significant portion of these girls have asked for my help), how I help or something I said might have been mansplaining or seen as such. After thinking about it some more, I realized that when I help people with homework, I always reiterate the basic concepts used to answer some parts of questions, working up from a base level of knowledge. I never think about whether the person I'm helping knows these concepts or not because I usually find the trouble with their understanding comes from their grasp of these concepts anyways. Maybe this is mansplaining because some of these girls think I'm assuming they don't know the concepts. To be honest I'm still not too sure what mansplaining exactly is but my sister also stated there is a subjective element to it, like all human interaction.\n\nThe reason I focus on these time when I help the girls on my major as a reason for them to vote for me as a top mansplainer is because I don't talk to them outside of our major. I'm really only friendly with about 2 of them. Most of my friends are outside of the my major anyways.\n\nAgain, I'm conflicted on how to feel. I understand that they face challenges that I will never fully understand, but I also don't feel good that this poll exists. I feel that if you don't ask for help in good faith, then I wasted my time helping you in the first place over these last few years. I realize these negative feelings are bleeding out into my interactions with the girls in my major that I do interact with in class because I'm just zoned out during those interactions, almost resorting to a list of automated responses.\n\nDo I just let it go? Do I talk to one of the girls in my major that I'm closer with about my behavior so I can fix it going forward? Am I wrong to feel conflicted? I'd like some insight/answers to these questions so I can stop being fixated on this.

This chance, however, is only about 1 in 154,000 for a typical Pew Research Center survey. To obtain that rough estimate, we divide the current adult population of the U.S. (about 235 million) by the typical sample size of our polls (usually around 1,500 people). Telephone numbers for Pew Research Center polls are generated through a process that attempts to give every household in the population a known chance of being included. Of course, if you don\u2019t have a telephone at all (about 2% of households), then you have no chance of being included in our telephone surveys.\n\n>Once we\u2019ve completed a survey, we adjust the data to correct for the fact that some individuals (e.g., those with both a cellphone and a landline) have a greater chance of being included than others. For more on how that\u2019s done, see the discussion of weighting in our detailed survey methodology.\n\n>**Can I volunteer to be polled?**\n\n>While we appreciate people who want to participate, we can\u2019t base our polls on volunteers. A survey of volunteers is a \u201cnon-probability sample\u201d and the results cannot be generalized to the public as a whole. The key to survey research is to have a random sample so that every type of person has an equal chance of having their views captured. Polls of volunteers would violate this principle since not everyone would have had an equal chance of being included. (See probability and non-probability sampling for more information.) And more specifically, the kinds of people who might volunteer for our polls are likely to be very different from the average American \u2013 at the least they would probably be more politically interested and engaged.", "grover-large": "I'm a female in my major and don't think this is mansplaining.

Three years ago we let him see his adoption file and told him what little we knew about his biological parents. John became obsessed with finding them, and within a month we found their information online. His birth mother died in 2009. His biological father, Sam, is married with two young daughters. He was 16 when my son was conceived.\n\nWe made contact. After DNA testing confirmed Sam's paternity, he and his family were very receptive, and a reunion soon followed. Sam is a great guy and he and John have built a close bond over the past two years. We live about an hour away. Sam and John now frequently hike and fish/hunt, play sports and do things that I am not as fit or inclined to do (Sam is half my age; my health is poor). John gets along great with his new sisters, and joined their 10 day family vacation to Hawaii over the holidays.\n\nLast week John asked us if he could move in with Sam's family. He wasn't callous or cruel about it. He had a whole speech written out, and delivered it through tears. Basically he said he loves us and will always be grateful, but that he is happier with Sam's family. He wants to live with them and spend a few weekends each month with us. He had spoken to Sam, who is open to discussing it with us. Apparently Sam's wife is all for it too.\n\nThe last two years have been difficult for my wife and I for other reasons.

I think that's overly harsh but I do see her point.\n\nIn the long run I just want what's best for John. Sam is financially secure, young and healthy, with a sweetheart of a wife.

I posted this on AITA and people seem to think it's fair for me to ask, but I want to do it respectfully and politely so I'm asking for advice here.\n\nBasically I (16M) recently moved in with my brother (24M) and his husband (26M). They got married about three months ago and just got their first place together. Before that they lived in the family house along with my dad (45M) my sister (18F) my brother (19M) and it was pretty crowded, I had to share a room with my middle brother and we were always on top of everyone all the time. We've never had that much money which is why my brother lived there with us and his now husband, to contribute to the bills and stuff.\n\nPretty much straight after my brother got married his husband kind of fell into a really well paid job (he didn't even apply for it, just got offered it and obviously took it) and they had actual money for the first time in their life, so my brother and his husband decided to get their own place and give my dad money every month for the family household bills.\n\nThey asked if I wanted to move out with them to a nicer part of town into a bigger house where the schools are better and I agreed because it was a generous offer, I really appreciate that they still thought of me even though they were finally getting their own house. My brother and I are pretty close and I'm genuinely thankful for the offer.\n\nSo far it's been really good, my school is much better and my grades are up, the house and area are really nice, except for one problem- my brother and his husband are really really loud in bed. And I do mean really loud. They also do it pretty much every day, sometimes more than once and it's so awkward to just be downstairs doing my homework and then hear that. I can put my headphones on to drown it out and stuff but sometimes I can't find them or my brother and his husband are louder than normal and I end up hearing everything. It's so uncomfortable when I see my brother straight after if he comes into the kitchen or something and all I can think about is what I just heard.\n\nI'm definitely aware that they put themselves out by asking me to live with them, I'm benefitting from the arrangement way more than they are and also they've been together for something like 7 years but never had their own place before so I kind of understand why they're going at it a lot now, they didn't have the privacy before.\n\nIt might be relevant to say that my brother's husband is basically the coolest dude ever and I think it was actually his idea to ask me if I wanted to live with them and go to a better school, so I don't have anything problems with them apart from this (and his husband's hilarious cooking lol) we all get on really well.\n\nTl;dr how can I tell my brother that his loud sex life is awkward for me in a way that shows I appreciate all they've done for me?", "permalink": "/r/relationships/comments/f0bvyy/how_do_i_16m_tell_my_brother_24m_that_i_can_hear/", "id": "f0bvyy", "subreddit": "relationships", "op": "taawkwardbro"}, "best_advice": {"bestadvice_id": "fgsp535", "bestadvice_score": 411, "bestadvice_submitted_time": 1581089640.0, "bestadvice_body": "You could try and be quote discreet, and thoughtful, about it and say something like...\n\n\"Hey bro, I absolutely love living with you guys, I honestly am so thankful for your hospitality but I'm very aware that you guys are newlyweds, so hey if you ever want me to make myself scarce so you can enjoy the house to yourselves just say the word and  I'll go for a jog/coffee/library.\"\n\nHe may not even be aware of it, so you saying something as discreet as this may give him pause for thought.\n\nThe other thing you could do is, whilst hes in the bedroom, play your music at a reasonable volume so he can see how much the sound travels.

I literally wanted to upload the pictures but i realised that there\u2019s no function to upload pictures in this subreddit. kk I'll upload 'em r/cats i guess and you guys should see this\n\n.\n\n2.\n\nThanks to his mother, the way to the cinema was smooth.\n\nAnd e finally watched a movie. But the problem started here. There was a tremendous pain because the tube injected with painkillers was slightly pressed... the fk. The pain prevented me from focusing on the movie at all. There was more terrible pain than the pain I felt when I pulled out my nail without anesthesia. I vomit enough blood to soak several tissues, but the pain did not stop. My boyfriend patted me by the side and helped me well, and later on, I could concentrate on the movie. Nevertheless, I'm still not sure what the movie is about. lol\n\n.\n\n3.\n\nAfter the movie, we strolled around the park to reach his house. We talked about stories: such as the lack of future together, the fear of death, the pain of illness, the longing of everyday life. And we did what ordinary couples could do, such as holding each other's hands or folding their arms or hug...(it's pretty shy to say myself lol) Like an \"ordinary\" person. It was a pity that I lacked one hand because of the cane.\n\n.\n\n4.\n\nBack to his house, we played with the cat and left a video to last out memories with an expectation that someone would watch this video and miss me. And we exchanged letters with each other's symbols and just cried. a lot. I still don't want to die, but an uplifting feeling-the fear of dying soon, the need to leave my loved ones, and the sadness of the person in front of me etc-overlapped with tears. And we promised to see each other next life.\n\n.\n\n5.\n\nWe left his house because of the time limit back to the hospital. And i also said goodbye his cat. i'll miss her so much. And my boyfriend kindly guided me close to the hospital! how kind of him <3 It's too sad to leave such a good person. Where we broke up, we cried a lot again. It's really the last now. It's really over. Such thoughts.\n\n.\n\n6.\n\nSo, I'm a hospital again. As always, I am now in a hospital uniform with the hospital meal. But it still feels like his cat's hair is on my clothes and he's hugging me. The futon seems to smell his. I will miss today so much. maybe i'll be happy thinking about this day until I die. hehe\n\n.\n\n7.\n\nAnd sadly, because of the age or health conditions or etc, there\u2019s so lottttssssss of advice I couldn\u2019t make it real. I\u2019m so sorry about that. Even just walking was hard things for me!

Now none of my friends will talk to me", "selftext": "Long one, sorry.\n\nWhen I (19M) was at high school, I had a really tight knit group of friends. There were maybe ten of us, plus some others who hung around sometimes, and we used to have a lot of house parties and spend a lot of time with each other. Most of us didn't really have any other friends, but we mostly got on really well as a group and I enjoyed spending time with all of them.\n\nOne of the guys in the group (B, 18M), I clicked with immediately when I met him (when we were around 16). I immediately had a bit of a crush on him, and by all reports he liked me back. However, I was still figuring myself out, and didn't realise I was gay yet, and I pretty soon after got into a long term relationship with a girl. B also got into a relationship around the same time, with another guy. Both of these relationships lasted 1.5-2 years. My relationship was absolutely terrible, as I was a closeted gay man in a relationship with a woman, and she actually has since realised she's a lesbian (honestly that relationship could be a whole other post but I won't go into it too much). Suffice to say I had a lot of regrets about that. Just after I broke up with my girlfriend, B also broke up with his boyfriend, for unrelated reasons.\n\nWe immediately turned to each other in the aftermath of the breakups, as we both felt we were going through a similar thing. We'd still remained friends throughout these couple of years, but we got much closer, and spent a lot of time together one on one. Not officially dates, but could probably be interpreted as dates by an outside perspective. After a couple of months, I asked B out properly, and we started to consider ourselves boyfriends. Another couple of months later, and we temporarily moved in together (I know that's way too soon to move in with someone, it was just temporary over the summer as he had been kicked out of his house and I was about to move away for college anyway, so I thought there was no harm in us living together for a month or so). During this time, I had a lot of mental health problems, and I was very stressed due to my job, and I recognise I probably didn't treat him as well as I should have (distant and moody, didn't really want to have sex much, irritable).\n\nAfter our time living together was up, and he'd found somewhere more permanent to live, I sat him down and broke up with him. B was a really nice guy, but I felt that we'd gotten together too soon after I'd gotten out of a bad relationship, and I wasn't really in a place to be dating someone at that time. I felt like I'd treated him quite badly, and he deserved better than that. I was also about to move a few hours away for college and I didn't feel like I could keep up a long distance relationship (and maybe selfishly I wanted to use college as an opportunity to experiment and maybe sleep around a little bit). I tried to make the breakup as amicable as I could, but obviously he was upset, which is very understandable. I didn't talk to him much after that, as I wanted to give him space.\n\nThen I moved away. We had a group chat with all of my friends in, and I would send messages about what I was up to, asking how everyone was, and the occasional meme I thought the group would find funny etc, which is what everyone used the chat for normally. But people stopped replying to me, and ignoring it when I sent messages. I thought I was imagining it at first, but then when I messaged people individually they would also ignore me. Eventually I left the group chat as I realised no one would talk to me any more. When I came home for the holidays, everyone said they were busy and couldn't meet up with me. Eventually I asked one of the people in the group I was closest to what was going on and she said they all felt like they couldn't be friends with me any more because I broke up with B, and he was their friend too, effectively choosing him over me (I never asked them to choose one of us, but apparently B did) because he still lived in the same place and I'd left.\n\nWhat can I do? I've made new friends at college, but I had a lot of good times with my high school group and I really valued their friendship. Now when I go visit my hometown, I have no friends there, even though they mostly still live there. How can I convince them I'm not evil and can still be their friend?\n\nTL;DR: I dated a close friend of mine, and then broke up with him and moved away to College.

I have 4 kids whom I consider myself pretty close with. My partner has a 16-year-old daughter and their relationship makes me uncomfortable. I\u2019ve talked to her about it numerous times and she always becomes very defensive.\n\nWhen I first started dating my partner, her daughter (15 at the time) slept with her mom every night. I put my foot down on that one right away. I asked my partner for our bed to be only our bed as I would often spend nights at her house. Then, it turned into the daughter going in there and \u201ccuddling\u201d with her mom when I wasn\u2019t there. When I say cuddling, I mean that the daughter will spoon her mother and lightly scratch her all over, including areas that I consider private (breasts, butt, lower tummy) The daughter will reach under the shirt and into the underwear to do this. As far as I know the vagina has never been touched, but she goes low enough to feel pubic hair. I tried to explain that the thought of being intimate with my partner in a bed that she shared with her daughter creeped me out. I now live with my partner. There have been several times that the daughter has come into our room and tried to snuggle both of us. She strokes my arms and will try to spoon me as well (she does NOT go under my clothes!) She has touched my breasts over my clothes while lightly scratching and I find it uncomfortable. I try to make a joke out of it \u201cahhh, you just touched my boob!\u201d My partner will often hold her daughters hand while sitting on the couch, in the car or in a restaurant. It\u2019s more than just the cuddling and hand holding, it\u2019s this longing look she gets in her eyes while she does it that makes me uncomfortable, too. It\u2019s like she is in love with her mother. I have spoken with my partner about this and how she needs to start setting boundaries with her daughter. My partner always becomes defensive and then tries to tell me that I\u2019m just jealous of their relationship. But for the most part, once she calms down she cools it for a while.\n\nWell, yesterday it came to a head. My partner was taking a bath in our jet tub (no curtain) and I walk in to our bedroom after about 15 minutes and her 16 year old daughter is sitting on the toilet lid talking to her mother. She\u2019s just sitting there looking directly at her mom (almost ogling) as my partner is bathing, which I consider to be a private thing. I made a comment about \u201cok, I\u2019ll just leave you two alone\u201d and then left the room. The daughter continued to stay in there while her mom bathed for another 10-15 minutes. I came back into the room as my partner was exiting the tub and her daughter then left the room.\n\nI told her again that it makes me very uncomfortable that she has no boundaries with her daughter. My partner immediately becomes defensive and a fight ensues. I ended up telling my partner that it makes me feel so uncomfortable that I don\u2019t want her to even touch me. I told her that it actually makes me feel yucky. She accuses me of being jealous (I did say I felt like they had a more intimate relationship at times than we do.)\n\nAs a backstory, my partner raised her daughter essentially without a dad and with the help of her mother. She always says that \u201cit was just me and her for almost 15 years\u201d\n\nMy question is, am I overreacting?

I was really happy he wanted to mark the occasion and agreed gratefully right away. The earliest date we could find was today, and my father booked a restaurant in the city where my adult siblings including my twin live. He, my step-mum, and young half sister live fairly close. My husband and I live about 100 miles from this city, usually an easy train journey of 90 minutes or less.\n\nToday though, we had really bad weather that shut down all public transport from my town to the city. Neither my husband nor I wanted to take the risk of driving that distance in those conditions, so regretfully I called my dad to say we wouldn\u2019t be making it. I was hoping that he would offer to reschedule it, seeing as it was in part my birthday lunch. However he did not. I texted my adult siblings to say we wouldn\u2019t be able to make it, and they said that was a shame and we\u2019d be missed.\n\nI had a huge emotional reaction to this and cried all day on my husband\u2019s shoulder. I\u2019m struggling to understand this. My role in the family is one of those who remembers everybody\u2019s birthdays and reminds my siblings, organises family gifts and celebrations, arranges get togethers so we see each other regularly (my mum also does a lot of this and I learned it from her). I am really sensitive and conscientious about this and genuinely enjoy doing it. But now I feel angry and upset that I put effort into coordinating ways to bring us together and make memories, and it feels like nobody thought it would be important that I be there for my own birthday. I probably sound like a spoiled brat as it was also my twin\u2019s birthday who was able to attend, but I wish somebody had at least offered to reschedule it so I could be present- it\u2019s what I would have done.\n\nFrom this, I\u2019ve learned that I need to evaluate the effort I put in, with a view to doing less and allow others to step up more, and also work on communicating my feelings and needs in the moment. But I don\u2019t know if or how I should bring up my feelings with my dad and siblings. It\u2019s upset me so much that I feel my choices are either to avoid talking to them for a while until my hurt feelings are soothed, or to bring it up with them individually. What should I do? And if I decide to talk to any of them, what should I say?\n\nTL;DR Due to unavoidable circumstances, I couldn\u2019t attend mine and my twin\u2019s long-planned birthday lunch at short notice. The rest of my family went without me and I wish they hadn\u2019t.

My ex-fiancee was murdered by the man she was living with. It was a mess. Kids saw it go down. The beating she took was so brutal they couldn't determine if the cause of death was head trauma or strangulation.\n\nI know just how you feel. I was married to my wife for four years at the time, and I found out about my ex's murder late one night on the computer. We no longer lived in the same town, and we only saw each other maybe once or twice a year after I moved.\n\nWhen I found out, I was floored. The emotion sunk my soul with the darkness of surreal. I screamed at my desk before my computer. It was my most desperate scream ever, and not a single sound escaped my mouth. Emotion and heartache tore out of me so silently, so I didn't wake my wife.\n\nYour husband sounds much more understanding than my wife. I knew there was no way my wife would understand how deeply and suddenly heartbroken I'd become. My wife always saw this ex as a threat, and I knew if my wife knew how hard I was taking this... it would just open a can of worms I didn't want to open. And never did.\n\nI mourned my ex's death with a secret numbness. I was sick with grief. Also with regret about the way our relationship had ended. Guilt about how she'd tried to reconnect at one point right before I met my wife, and I was so angry about how we'd left things in the past, I completely blew her off. Of course, I have no bad feelings about her now. I was a lot younger then. Immature.\n\nI waited a year before I told my wife that my ex was murdered. I didn't plan it, but it came out, and I had time on my side to remain composed and seemingly act unaffected by it. Like it was common knowledge and happened too long ago for emotion to be an issue. But it was. Emotion was a big issue.\n\nMy ex-fiancee's murder was the single hardest thing I've ever been through. The raw love I have for this woman tangled my stomach and made tears just leak out of my face. Not crying. Not tearing up. At one point I was breathing like I am now and streams just poured from my eyes. I did think I might have been taking it too hard. That the feelings I discovered I still had for my ex were strange because I was married and had \"moved on.\"\n\nBut this was my high school sweetheart. My partner in crime. We both managed to keep stumbling into each other throughout our twenties until we were just a couple months away from our wedding. Good times. Bad times. Lonely times. Sad times. We shared a lot of our lives together.\n\nSo, while I did find it very strange that I took it so hard when it happened, when we weren't even a part of each others lives. That we both had moved on. We were both happy with our new lives. We both would've agreed that maybe we were never in love to begin with. I know now there was nothing wrong with how heartbroken I was. That pain was earned. And, really--and I'm sure you know this--completely unavoidable.\n\nLosing a loved one in such an unfair and savage end leads to all things unavoidable and that immense feeling of loss that's worsened by our immediate reaction to fix it and make things better again only to realize we have no control over any of this, and there is nothing we can do to make it better. Nothing.\n\nI think you grieve an important part of your past by allowing your grief to become an important part of your present. I am so sorry for your loss.

In that time, we have had a lot of really good times and a lot of bad times, but through it all I have always loved my wife and tried my best to take care of her and make us work well.\n\nMy wife has never communicated with me well. She suffers from depression, anxiety and can have mood swings. She constantly resorted to insults, passive aggressive comments, hostile comments and switching the subject of the conversation a lot. I have ADD and have a hard time following conversations that jump around, especially when I am nervous because we are arguing, and she knows that. She also has a bad habit of interrupting me when I am speaking which further confuses me and hurts my feelings. It gets to the point where I kind of just shut down and apologize for whatever she is upset about, regardless of how I feel about it because I assume I must have done something wrong for her to be so upset. I always try to forgive her and I always promise to take what she says seriously and do my best to improve. Sometimes the improvements are easier than others, but when I struggle with them or make a mistake, she gets upset too.\n\nShe has threatened to leave me dozens of times over the course of our relationship. I have always been terrified whenever she does this and the conversation immediately goes into damage control as I try to work out why she is saying that and what happened and what I can do to fix it or if I can do anything to fix it. It always ends with her deciding not to leave and us making up, and the next day we go back to acting happy and cheery like nothing happened. However, a few weeks ago she brought it up again and actually started going into detail with it. She was talking about division of money, who would take our cat, etc. I spent hours crying and talking with her and trying to work it out. In the end, it seemed as though her depression was making her try to distance herself from me. A common result of these conversations is \"You would be better off without me\", even if the whole time the conversation was about how I was causing her feelings of wanting to leave. We finally worked through it and she said that she didn't want to leave and wanted to improve us.\n\nThe only thing is, I haven't been able to get back to normal since. I feel like this last one hit me really hard, much harder than normal. I feel numb, and I can't seem to find those loving feelings I have always had. I am having a very hard time moving past it. I want my marriage to work but I am also not willing to sacrifice my self worth and self esteem just to be able to forgive her for hurting me again.

We knew each other in high school and more or less dated ever since then, so we were each other's first and only's for pretty much everything. It went from being friends, to dating, to being roommates, to being married. There was hardly even a proposal or anything, we were always happy together and knew ever since basically the tenth grade that it was destined to happen.\n\nWe had a good seven years before I lost her. We built a good life, traveled, accomplished a lot of goals. I can't complain too much because I had a great stretch with her, but ever since I lost her it's almost as if I lost an arm. I've heard stories from military veterans that when you lose a limb or something, you still sometimes feel it even after it's gone. I kind of feel like that. Sometimes I wake up and expect her to be there, only to realize I'm in an empty bed and I feel everything all over again to some degree.\n\nI've been through a lot of therapy on this. I'm no longer as depressed as I was, I've been able to move on with my life. I know she'd be kicking my ass if I weren't moving forward with fun plans and my career, so I've been able to do that fairly well.\n\nIt took a while, but dating is something I've tried to jump back into in the last year or two too. I know she'd be kicking my ass over that too, she'd never want me to mope around over that either. I've of course talked with my therapist over this too, but it's just never felt \"right\" to me. It's like there's a part of me that still expects her to be waiting at home for me, even when I'm out with some other woman.\n\nThat's where I could really use advice on this. I feel like I've moved on the best that I can, but I also feel like I've hit a brick wall to where I'll be. I'm always going to miss her and I'm always going to feel like she's still a part of my day to day life.\n\nBut at the same time, I also feel like I can't go on living in an empty house mourning her forever. All of my family and friends have subtly encouraged me along in this in the last year or two, introducing me to women and such. And I'm not gonna lie, I haven't... you know, since I lost her, and I'd frankly like to again. But more importantly it would be nice to have someone around to share stuff with again. Fun times out, stories, intimate details, whatever. I've got close friends, but it's just not the same as being with someone and I feel really lonely a lot.\n\nAnyways, anyone have any advice on this?  Should I keep trying, as awkward as it is?  Or should I just accept that I'll always be grieving on some level and I shouldn't hold out that much hope?\n\n---\n**tl;dr**: I lost my wife a long while ago and I've come to accept that I'll never entirely move on.

From June oneward i noticed, that she acted colder towards me and eventually confronted her about it...We broke up because, according to her, the spark had gone from our relationship and she was was no longer shure, that she loved me. I tried to fight for her (knowing that i wasn't allways the perfect boyfriend) and she supposedly tried too. After about 2 weeks of no sleep due to the situation we mutually called quits. It was hard for me (longest relationship of my life and the first one that I genuinly thought could go \"all the way\"), but i recovered to the Point where i started dating again.\n\nFast forwards 6(Keep that number in mind) months to mid january 2020 and the main part of the Story:\n\nI am doing rather well in life, having a decent job and dating an awesome woman (lets call her M, 22F) for a couple of weeks now. One evening I decide to go out and grab some food for me and M (who decided to stay in my Appartement) from a close by kebap-shop. As I am standing in line, I notice a guy standing behind me who I know from my days back in Uni. We get to talking, as we haven't seen each other since I finished my degree. We eventually get to the point of relationships and he tells me, that he has been in a commited relationship for allmost 9 months now. I congratulate him and turn around to get my order. As I finish up paying and am about to leave the Bistro I hear a familiar voice behind me and turn around to find J standing next to the guy, holding hands with him. That is actually the first time I have seen or heard from my ex for half a year. She has a look of embarassement on her face and at first my brain puts it off as \"well who wants to see his ex\", but then it dawns on me: the guy said, that they've been dating for close to 9 months...\nIn hindsight I am actually kinda proud of how I managed the situation. I simply turned to look at her with a facial expression equal to \"well that is one hell of a surprise\" and said: \"Wow, almost 9 months? I am *sooooo* happy for you guys.\" The guy was kinda oblivious to it, wich made me think, that J actually never told him about us. I wished them a nice time and left.\n\nOn the way back home (maybe 1km) I must've smoked like 5 cigarettes as every step further got me more and more mad. I had no f*cking clue, that she was cheating on me, but in hindsight it explains her behaviour towards me during the end of our relationship.\nI actually thought I was over the break up and getting better, but I must admit, that I feel like sh*t.\nWhen i finally got home, I had lost all appetite and M noticed that something was wrong. She asked me if I am alright and I made up some excuse about not feeling too well.\n\nHonestly I am terrified of talking to her about it. I am usually open about these things and so is she, but I am terrified, that she will interpret it as me still having romantic feelings towards J (which I am certain enough, I have *not*).\n\nI am honestly at a loss of how to Approach the subject and would love to hear some opinions on the matter.\n\nTL;DR\n\nMet ex-GF and her new BF by chance and learned that she cheated on me for at least 2 months of our relationship.

I also get the feeling that your fiancee tolerates being around your mom, and she may not really like her.

It's also possible that your mom was completely overbearing in the e-mail and made it sound as if your fiancee had no choice but to meet when your mom decided she could meet.

She should be free to decline the invitation without having to say anything other than she's not feeling it this time. This doesn't mean that she should skip out on all family meetings, but every once in a while isn't going to hurt anyone.\n\nI can also see where she would be frustrated with the way you argue about this. You seem to be asking her to prove that her feeling are valid by giving concrete examples of when you chose your mom over you (or other bad events in the past). This is not going to make anything better, and you can't force her to change the way she feels by pointing out that it's been a few months or years since the last event. You need to work on what will happen in the future, come up with a strategy when she feels overwhelmed by your mom. Show her that you have her back, listen to what she says, and don't argue with her and try to convince her that she is wrong to feel the way she feels.\n\nI do think that your communication could definitely use a bit of work, and a good couple's counselor might help with that.", "grover-large": "I think you can bring up her infidelity and you and your gf can get on with your life.

That distance often comes to the parents, so the solution isn't to get her to be friends with other children in the neighborhood, it's to connect her to resources and outlets that aren't necessarily available to her.\n\nFor example, maybe she's scared to go into a movie theater. She sees no other reason to go to the movies. She could be doing it because she has no other outlet for interaction other than her TV.\n\nWhat's her favorite food and TV show? What is her most annoying habit?\n\nThe last thing, of course, is that she's an addict and needs coping mechanisms to make sense of all the feeling she gets when she does the above - thinking that 'something's wrong with her when she doesn't even know she's doing it', without being able to articulate that feeling to her the way she's trying to.\n\nBasically it might be getting her to recognize that a problem is really just that, a problem, rather than identifying an actual symptom of her problem.\n\nSo, how can you get her to go outside on her own without you having to yell at her for watching TV?  If she doesn't watch any less TV, how can you get her to recognize that even when she does do something it isn't even OK to watch TV?\n\nWithout that, how can you prevent her from using and spending all of her free time on the internet?\n\nIn my experience, if you've done your best to try to get her out there and outside on her own, she tends to become very connected to the internet and lose all interest in something without an external outlet that isn't violent, scary, or violent pornography.\n\nIf, after you've tried to get her out there and into a more natural activity that doesn't involve the internet, she's already hit the cycle of him watching television, then you're just going to have to brace yourself for the latter of these things, because she's going to be very disconnected from the outside world, very, very very dependent on the internet. (I'm not a parent, but if my child didn't care about them much as I do, I would be leaving them alone with my computer all day long - absolutely nobody I know lets their kids watch TV unless it's a warning that they have to be told, or they need to do something they don't want to do.)\n\nHow do you even talk to her about this?

Kind of using reddit as a last resort.\nSo the reason I\u2019m here is basically for advice or ideas.\n\nA bit of back story. I had been on a weekend away through work. When I got home on the Monday I realised my work phone had been left on my bedside table, I had left it there after using it to record my sleep talking using one of those sound activating sleep apps. So I thought I\u2019d give it a listen to see what nonsense I had been talking while asleep Friday evening.\nAfter listening to fridays I then kept listening to see what my wife had been doing whilst I was away. I felt uneasy about this as it felt like spying but I did it anyway.\nWhat I stumbled across made me sick to my stomach.\nShe had been round a mutual friends house for a bbq on the Saturday night and when she got home she made a drunken phone call to another mutual friend (we will call him douche bag)\nThe phone call goes something like this from her end \u201cHi where did you go? Oh ok just wondered where you\u2019d gone. Did you have fun tonight? Good me too. I\u2019m glad we can be friends again after what happened between us last year. Yeah I\u2019d like to too but if Matt finds out I\u2019d be fucked and he\u2019s probably kill you. Blah blah blah ok bye\u201d\nSo naturally after hearing this I confronted my wife and she denied it all and just said what happened a year ago was they\u2019d both had a drinker chat and said they\u2019d probably get together if I wasn\u2019t around (ouch) this was obviously hurtful to hear but not grounds to leave a marriage for.\nSince then (it\u2019s been about 6 months) I am 99% sure something happened between them and i feel like a prick for just letting them both get away with it but I can\u2019t just leave her without proof. We share a lot of mutual friends and most of them originate from me and if I leave her for no reason I\u2019m worried that I\u2019ll be shunned for being the bad guy.\nI have a plan though and this is where I need ideas. So in a couple of weeks I\u2019m away again. This time I\u2019m going to Leave listening devices in a couple of key rooms, living room bedroom kitchen etc.\nI found a website that will send a private message to any number and you can also set a time in which to send it.\n\nI\u2019m going to have this text sent about 10 minutes before I leave so she knows it\u2019s not me that\u2019s sending it. Then when I leave I\u2019m hoping the text will be enough bait her to ring douche bag in a panicked state and ask him if he said anything to anyone about what happened hopefully being specific about what that thing is.\nI need ideas on what I can write in that text? I was thinking. \u201cHi just found out what happened between you and douche bag last year, hope your husband doesn\u2019t find out\u201d then she\u2019s ring him saying \u201cdid you tell anyone what did last year?\u201d\nYou get the idea. So yeah I need ideas what to put in that text that will bait her to be specific about what she\u2019s saying.\nI\u2019m still young so if I can get out of this now rather than ten years down the line that would be good. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m looking for an excuse because I\u2019m not, before all this I was happy and now I\u2019m almost certain I\u2019m sharing a bed with a woman that\u2019s cheated on me.", "permalink": "/r/relationship_advice/comments/f2ocb9/baiting_my_wife_to_confess_the_truth/", "id": "f2ocb9", "subreddit": "relationship_advice", "op": null}, "best_advice": {"bestadvice_id": "fhdzg5v", "bestadvice_score": 208, "bestadvice_submitted_time": 1581508778.0, "bestadvice_body": "If you don't trust her then you know the answer.\n\nDon't send yourself crazy trying to find evidence, trust me, you will and you're already going down that road.\n\nI caught my ex sending albeit, not nudes but pictures posing in somewhat of a seductive stance alongside pictures of her wearing fantasy masks with whips etc..

The behaviors you describe -- i.e.,  verbal  abuse, suicide threats, temper tantrums, low self esteem, black-white thinking, inability to trust you, lack of impulse control, always being \"The Victim,\" and rapid flips  between Jekyll (loving you)  and  Hyde  (devaluing you)  --  are classic warning signs for BPD.\n\nImportantly, I'm  not  suggesting  your W has full-blown BPD. Instead, I'm  suggesting  she  may  be  exhibiting moderate to strong BPD symptoms. Of  course, learning  to spot BPD warning  signs will not  enable you to diagnose  her  issues. Although strong BPD  symptoms are easy  to   spot, only a   professional can  determine  whether they are so severe  and persistent as to constitute a  full-blown disorder.\n\nYet,   like learning warning signs for a stroke or heart attack,  learning  those for BPD  may  help you avoid a very painful situation -- e.g., by   helping  you leave a toxic marriage and avoid running into  the  arms  of another woman just like her. I  therefore  suggest you take  a    quick look at these BPD warning signs to see if most sound very  familiar:\n\n1. Black-white  thinking, wherein she categorizes everyone as \"all good\" or \"all bad\" and will recategorize someone -- in just a few  seconds -- from  one  polar  extreme to the other based on a minor infraction;\n2. Frequent use of all-or-nothing expressions like \"you always\" and \"you never;\"\n3. Irrational jealousy and controlling behavior that tries to isolate you away from close friends or family members;\n4. A   strong sense of entitlement that prevents her from appreciating  your sacrifices, resulting in a \"what have you done for me  lately?\"  attitude  and a double standard;\n5. Flipping, on a dime, between adoring you and devaluing you -- making you feel like you're always walking on eggshells;\n6. Frequently creating drama over issues so minor that neither of you can recall what the fight was about two days later;\n7. Low self esteem;\n8. Verbal  abuse and anger that is easily triggered, in seconds, by a  minor thing   you say or do (real or imagined), resulting in temper      tantrums that   typically last several hours;\n9. Fear of abandonment or being alone -- evident in her expecting you to  \u201cbe there\u201d for her on demand, making unrealistic demands for the  amount of time spent together, or responding with intense anger to even brief   separations or slight changes in plans;\n10. Always being \"The Victim,\" a false self image she validates by blaming you for every misfortune;\n11. Lack of impulse control, wherein she does reckless things without considering the consequences (e.g., binge eating or spending);\n12. Complaining that all her previous BFs were abusive and  claiming, during the first few months of your relationship,  that you are the only one  who  has  treated her  well;\n13. Mirroring   your personality and preferences so perfectly during  the courtship period (e.g., enjoying everything and everyone you  like)  that you were convinced you had met your \"soul mate;\"\n14. Relying  on you to center and ground her, giving her a sense of  direction   because her goals otherwise keep changing every few months;\n15. Relying on you to sooth her and calm her down, when she is stressed, because she has so little ability to do self soothing;\n16. Having no close long-term friends (unless they live a long distance away) even though she may have many casual friends;\n17. Taking  on the personality of whatever person she is talking to,  thereby acting quite differently around different types of people;  and\n18. Always  convinced that her intense feelings accurately reflect   reality --  to  the point that she often \"rewrites history\" because she regards her own   feelings as self-evident facts, despite her inability to support   them with any hard evidence.\n\nIf  most of those behaviors ring bells and raise questions, I would be  glad to discuss them with you -- and I would recommend you see a   psychologist (for a visit or two all by yourself) to obtain a candid   professional opinion on what you and your daughter are dealing with.\n\nI caution that BPD is not something -- like chickenpox -- that a person  either *\"has\"*  or *\"doesn't have.\"*    Instead, it is a spectrum disorder,  which  means  every adult on the  planet occasionally exhibits all BPD traits  to  some  degree (usually   at a low level if the person is healthy).\n\nAt  issue, then, is  not whether your W exhibits BPD  traits. Of  course   she does. We  all do. Rather, at issue is whether she exhibits those   traits at a strong level  (i.e., is on the upper  end of  the BPD   spectrum).\n\nNot having  met her, I  cannot answer that question. I nonetheless  believe you can spot any strong BPD  warning  signs that are  present if  you  take a little time to  learn which  behaviors are on the list.", "grover-large": "A lot of men are really apathetic about cheating.

From the start, I put myself in the friend-zone, very explicitly telling her that I couldn't even think about a long-term relationship and was just interested in companionship. She said she was in the same place.\n\nI've always hated Valentine's Day, even while married, and was kind of dreading the upcoming day. Thinking she might also be feeling strange, I asked her if she wanted to have an anti-Valentine's Day dinner together. She said she'd love to. Great. We'd have fun together on a lousy day for newly single people. At first the 14th didn't work for her, but then she changed her plans so we could have dinner on the actual day.\n\nI didn't think much of the dinner, she and I have gone out alone before, but multiple friends of mine asked what was going on... what my intentions were. I repeated what I said above. Then they asked, \"Does she feel the same way?  Does she want something more?\"  I think she still just wants to be friends, but now they have me worried about this, because I don't want to lead her on or hurt her. I've never been friends with many women, I really enjoy her company, and I wouldn't want to jeopardize our friendship.\n\nFor further background, and I think this is relevant, on the ladder of attractiveness, she's a top rung and I'm one of the safe steps below the middle. Yes, you read that right, and yes, in my heart, I just want to be friends (let the gender stereotypes begin!). Also, we both recently got on dating apps and have talked about it, and neither of us have any kids.\n\nSo, should I believe that we're still both on the same page?  I'm hesitant to bring it up, because then it seems paranoid or weird. Are there signs I should look for to indicate that her feelings have changed?  Or are my guy friends just reading way too much into this?\n\nTL;DR: going on a platonic Valentine's Day dinner with another recently divorced friend. I am just interested in friendship, but my friends think she may be thinking about more.

It\u2019s common for parents to use their kids info to sign up for utility accounts, credit cards, etc. Make sure your credit reports are clean, then freeze your credit. There are guides on r/personalfinance that are very thorough.\n\nOk so what does your brother do now about this lease. He can go to the police or not go to the police.

If he doesn\u2019t report now he may not be able to report later as the statute of limitations may come into play. If the parents default on rent it will impact his credit. His name and credit will almost certainly be tied to the lease as long as your parents live at this apartment, even if they stay for years and years, because the lease will renew and his name will still be on it. If the lease shows up on his credit report as legit then it may keep him from getting additional credit like if he wants to buy a house in a few years or whatever.\n\nI\u2019m not going to tell you what to do but this is a big deal and it\u2019s going to affect someone for years.

I've been living alone in my apartment for about two and a half years, and I have very few neighbors (it's a small building of 12 apartments, and two out of the four apartments that surround mine are empty). The neighbors upstairs are two very aggressive and addicted men who everyone hates, so we don't talk to them.\n\nMy downstairs neighbor is a widow in her late 60s  early 70s , her husband died while they were sleeping about two years ago, and they had no children, she has no family and her only real life \"friends\" is an elderly couple who live on the other side of the building (they just say hi and talk for a bit when they meet on the hallway). I say \"friends\" because she says she has many, but all online, she kind of works selling stuff on Facebook and Twitter.\nShe has a few mobility issues (she can walk but used a cane and is very slow), so she hired a girl to help her do basic stuff like walking down to the grocery store, going to the bank with her,etc. The girl is on summer vacation so she asked me if I could buy some things for her when I go to the store, I said yeah sure  No problem. But then she said \"great, so you can come with me to the bank on Monday, and then take me to pay the bills\" she didn't ask it, she said it.\nI helped her a few times (walked her down the street, or went to the store for myself and got her a few things on the way). We share my WiFi and she's super responsible when she has to pay.\n\nThe thing is, that's about as much as I can help, because I have a full time job, and I'm barely in my house. I feel like shit having to say no to her many requests to: help her fix her cellphone, or explain to her why her Facebook doesn't work because someone \"reported\" her account (I don't use Facebook so I wouldn't know how to help her), she texts me constantly telling me to drop by, but every time I do she talks for hours about her medication and depression, and her husband... I get it, I know she's lonely and I swear it breaks my heart. But I can't be her friend or her companion.\nI can be a helpful neighbor once in a while, and I help her (selflessly, I think) as much as I can. It's peak summer here and the power has been out for the last two or three days in the neighborhood, so I haven't been home much. Right now I'm writing this because she's begging me to go help her with something she didn't say what was, but I know it's just an excuse to talk to someone. Again, this breaks my heart but I have commitments to attend to.\n\nHow do I politely tell her that I can't be there all the time, that I am not her companion?\n\nI don't want to offend her, she's sweet and very kind, but I feel really uncomfortable when she asks me to be a companion.\n\nTl;dr : My elder neighbor is being dependant of me and I feel like shit having to put a stop on it.", "permalink": "/r/relationships/comments/f0uq62/my_31f_downstairs_neighbor_6570ish_f_is_relying/", "id": "f0uq62", "subreddit": "relationships", "op": "MaggieSmithsSass"}, "best_advice": {"bestadvice_id": "fgyivun", "bestadvice_score": 174, "bestadvice_submitted_time": 1581183801.0, "bestadvice_body": "\"I love to be able to help you when I have the time, but I am dealing with x,y, and also z, which means I can't drop everything each time you need it.\"\n\nShe sounds like she needs to get some sort of daily care package arranged by whatever sort of adult social services there is in the area.

I need help in a matter involve tenant-landlord. My landlord is threatening to bring us to court for **eviction**. We are currently renting a room in a house. We are going to move out on Feb 15 with the termination of the lease. We **don't owe rent**. We **paid upfront for 6 months.**\n\nThe reason she said she wanted to bring us to court is that we didn't let her show the unit to potential renters. As a matter of fact, we didn't get informed that she was showing the unit. We were out of town from Feb 6 - Feb 9. She put up a notice on Feb 6 to gain her access to the unit from 8 am-5 pm for a week straight including weekends (Feb 8 - Feb 15) without our knowledge/consent beforehand. In the notice, she didn't state the reason to come on the premise either. We didn't get any emails or phone calls about the notice. On Feb 8 at 11.30 pm, we received an email from her stating that she would hire a locksmith to break in the room (she didn't have a key to our room because she lost it) because we didn't leave the key for her. Note that we left the key for her many times before but she never went to make a duplicated key herself. We specifically emailed her after we saw the notice on Feb 9 that we will let her show the unit, but she needed to give us a more specific and reasonable time, not a big time frame like that, because what if we are having a private life and she just walks in. She didn't respond to the email until we saw her in person in the kitchen today (Feb 10) at 8 pm. We tried to explain again when she demanded the key. Afterward, she said she will go to court tomorrow and file an eviction without any 3-day notice. Right after we left the kitchen, she put up a new proper 24-hour notice for us at 8.30 pm to give her access to the room within business-hour from Feb 10 - Feb 15. We told her because the notice was put up **after business-hour on Monday**, we would go make her a duplicated key and give it to her **before Wednesday's business hour.** Inside the house has cameras so there are records of the time when she gave us the notice. She emailed us back and said we were making up a story and demanded the key tomorrow before 8 am (which is **12 hours** since the notice).\n\nThe reason we were so paranoid with her because last time when she gave the notice to come in the room with an inspector within the business hours, she just came in at 7.30 am right after we left for school by herself in a rope snooping around our room and taking pictures. We had the video evidence because we had a camera in the room.\n\nCan she actually take us to court and evict us? Can we sue her for harassing?

It basically was 2 years of bottled frustration coming to a head. She eventually ended up finding new employment at two different places, both in the same field.

The one place had a hard time coming up with a reason as to why they were terminating her, giving excuses from \"you're too high energy\" to saying it was about her going to her car twice to grab a pad. I didnt think much of it at the time, as I figured maybe her boss just didnt like her, as her performance didnt seem to be the issue. This firing came a day after the boss who fired her had told her she was going to make her a key to the store so she could come in early to handle some paperwork the day prior to the termination. The following day, her second place of employment did the same thing, this time not even being able to give her a reason, telling her shes great at what she does and they are really sorry, but they have to let her go. At some point, she did overhear her boss talking to another employee saying \"I dont want to, but my lawyers are directing me to do it.\"\n\nTo me, this seems that her boss from the job she had left in december is pulling some shady stuff and contacting her employeers telling them that they have a noncompete with her, when in fact they dont.

I rang the doorbell, mom comes out, and I tell her what happened. She says, boys, \"come inside\"! And then, \"which one did it?\" I told her, he admitted that he did it. Then, she closed the door.\n\nI live about 3 min away so I drove home and had my neighbor look at my car with me. There are 3 dents where the block of ice hit. I just bought this car certified pre-owned and had only made one payment at this time so I know for a fact that the damage is from the block of ice. I drove back to the house and said hey look, my car is damaged so I'd like to exchange info so I can get this fixed.

I say no, I just want my car fixed. He tells them they are lucky that's all I want, agrees to write the police report. The mother gives her side, lies to the police and tells them her kid's friend who is no longer present is the one who threw the ice. It was actually her younger son. I didn't correct her because I was so shocked and confused and the other boy wasn't there at the time. Over the next two days, I go get an estimate for the repair ($1327) and a copy of the police report.

I expect this will land in small claims court because the parents seem positioned to ignore and then say that I can't prove anything, plus they are placing blame on the boys' friend who won't speak to the police.

I do all of these things because I love him and I love seeing him happy.\n\nHowever, he doesn\u2019t reciprocate meaningful or sometimes even courteous actions. I asked him to stop at the store for me today which he promptly responded with a no, he refuses to watch one of my favorite movies with me (that he has never seen) because it\u2019s not \u201chis type of movie\u201d, he has laughed while I have cried so incredibly hard, literally pushes me away from him when he doesn\u2019t want me around him anymore. I have watched countless hours of sports I don\u2019t like just to spend time together but he won\u2019t do anything like that for me. He tells me that he loves me but never actually \u201cshows\u201d it. This has me doubting his love for me at all. Maybe he just thinks he\u2019s in love with me because his actions speak so differently.\n\nI don\u2019t know what I am looking for in this post.

We've been long-distance for about a year now. I have been planning to relocate to be with him this summer. Right now, we visit each other every three weeks or so.\n\nLate last year, my BF asked if he could tell me a secret. He said that he has always been interested in a certain sexual fetish, and never told anyone because he was quite embarrassed. The fetish was female domination, including \"sissy\" play, pegging, humiliation, etc. My BF is a highly educated man with a PhD from one of the top schools in the world. He's the President of a company and works long, stressful hours. He said that he was interested in femdom because it allowed him to be submissive and let go of his responsibilities for a bit.\n\nWe had a pretty flavorful sex life already, and I consider myself to be quite open-minded, so I told him we could give it a try. I didn't *love* it and it didn't sexually excite me, but it wasn't that bad. Kind of fun, in a non-sexual way, once in a while. He seemed to really love it, so I didn't mind indulging once in a while.\nHe started to get really obsessed with it, and it kind of consumed our long-distance sex life. I asked him to please dial it back a little bit, and he seemed really embarrassed but finally obliged after getting a bit upset with me.\n\nHowever, a few months later, he started to obsess again. It kind of took over our sexting sessions, our Skype sex, etc. I became annoyed and I talked to him about how big a part of our lives this was going to be. I told him that I was concerned about our sexual compatibility because I was fine with this as a once-in-a-while thing but not a lifestyle. He told me that it was just a bedroom thing and we didn't have to do it if I didn't want to.\n\nI'll mention that when we are together in person, he is not this obsessive. We do the femdom stuff like once a month, which is fine, because my needs are being met elsewhere. But when we're apart, he is so focused on it and it is really turning me off. HE turns me on, not these characters he plays. I don't like how he changes his appearance. Yesterday, he wanted to do some roleplay long-distance. He told me he had an idea. We have little cameras in our bedrooms so we can \"spy\" on each other. He wanted to pretend that someone had placed a secret camera in his bedroom and caught him doing sissy stuff, and then blackmailed him with it later. I would take screenshots through the camera and send them to him from a fake e-mail at a later time. Sounded fine to me.\n\nExcept, in his scenario, we were \"us\" and he acted like he invited a \"woman\" over to dominate him behind my back. He acted like someone else was pegging him, like he needed a break to text me and tell me he was watching a movie, like he was making out with and touching another \"woman\", like \"she\" did him up in drag. And when I sent him screenshots as \"blackmail\", he begged me not to tell his girlfriend (me).\n\nI feel like my willingness to get into this for him is being taken advantage of. He knows I don't particularly enjoy it, but all his scenarios involve this femdom stuff. And I am SO hurt that he would incorporate cheating on me into this fantasy. I am honestly really devastated.\n\nI don't know what to do. He gets very embarrassed when I bring up his fetish in a negative way and I don't know what to say to him. It's going to destroy my attraction to him, and this fake cheating really hurt my feelings.\n\nWhat do I say? What do I do?

Ideally, you want to do this in person or over the phone.\n\nHere are some questions for you to consider before having that conversation:\n\nDo you feel like you can ask your bf for a total break from this kink, even if it's just for a short time? If you said \"I don't want to do any femdom or sissy play for 3 months.\" would he honor that or would he react badly and punish you?\n\nDoes your boyfriend understand why the cheating roleplay bothered you so much? Has he given you a heartfelt apology?\n\nDo your sexual and relational needs get met in this relationship? Is your boyfriend putting as much effort into your sexual preferences as you are into his?\n\nIs your boyfriend good at taking care of you after the scene? Physically and emotionally? This applies to both in person and long distance scenes.\n\nIf you are looking at these questions and feeling like your needs aren't getting met, like your BF isn't putting in the effort that you are, like you're expected to service his kink no matter what, like a 3 month break would be a huge problem...you need to take a harder look at the foundation of your relationship.\n\nIf all those things are good, and he just got a little carried away with a new shiny toy, you may be able to reset things by taking a break (again, I would say at least 3 months) from this particular kink and reinvest in other parts of your relationship.

No offense to anyone out there, but femdom just ended up being a huge turn off for me. I ended up no longer being attracted to my ex (for other reasons as well, but I knew this was the main reason I was no longer sexually attracted to him). I also tend to have a very high sex drive and I literally did not want to have sex for three months. The last few times I had sex with him I mainly did it not because I wanted but just so I could make him happy.\n\nIf I could go back in time I would have sat down with him and told him the truth. I would have told him I am happy we can try new things together but I ended up not enjoying femdom. I probably wouldn't be as turned off to it if I had spoken up sooner and made some boundaries. Just be open and make sure you don't come off in a way that could make your BF feel as if he is gross or anything. Make sure you figure out what you could be open to. You could make a compromise if you feel like you could be open to some of it still. I would tell him that you are still interested in indulging in the fetish every once and a while, but too much of the fetish makes you as if your needs are not being met and that its causing your relationship to feel less intimate and more tawdry.\n\nI hope this helps and everything works out! feel free to DM me."}, "turk_ratings": {"retrieval": {"is_preferred": false, "is_preferred_continuous": 0.0, "diagnostics": [{"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "helpful", "q3_justification": "writing", "worker_id_anonymized": 0}, {"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "helpful", "q3_justification": "writing", "worker_id_anonymized": 1}, {"q1_intensifier": 1, "q2_helpful_or_not": "helpful", "q3_justification": "writing", "worker_id_anonymized": 7}], "worker_ids_anonymized": [0, 1, 7]}, "grover-large": {"is_preferred": false, "is_preferred_continuous": 0.0, "diagnostics": [{"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "contradiction", "worker_id_anonymized": 1}, {"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "contradiction", "worker_id_anonymized": 4}, {"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "contradiction", "worker_id_anonymized": 3}], "worker_ids_anonymized": [1, 4, 3]}, "grover-mega": {"is_preferred": false, "is_preferred_continuous": 0.0, "diagnostics": [{"q1_intensifier": 1, "q2_helpful_or_not": "helpful", "q3_justification": "writing", "worker_id_anonymized": 6}, {"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "contradiction", "worker_id_anonymized": 3}], "worker_ids_anonymized": [2, 6, 3]}, "T5-3B": {"is_preferred": false, "is_preferred_continuous": 0.0, "diagnostics": [{"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "helpful", "q3_justification": "writing", "worker_id_anonymized": 0}, {"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "helpful", "q3_justification": "meaning", "worker_id_anonymized": 1}, {"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "helpful", "q3_justification": "meaning", "worker_id_anonymized": 6}], "worker_ids_anonymized": [0, 1, 6]}, "T5-11B": {"is_preferred": false, "is_preferred_continuous": 0.0, "diagnostics": [{"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "neutral", "worker_id_anonymized": 0}, {"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "neutral", "worker_id_anonymized": 6}, {"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "contradiction", "worker_id_anonymized": 8}], "worker_ids_anonymized": [0, 6, 8]}, "second_best_reddit_advice": {"is_preferred": false, "is_preferred_continuous": 0.0, "diagnostics": [{"q1_intensifier": 1, "q2_helpful_or_not": "helpful", "q3_justification": "writing", "worker_id_anonymized": 0}, {"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "helpful", "q3_justification": "writing", "worker_id_anonymized": 5}], "worker_ids_anonymized": [0, 1, 5]}}}

She will literally slap a blunt out of my hand so now I only smoke while she\u2019s gone but she still fusses at me. And to make it worse she is smoking my weed. I have a pretty decent stash in jars and vacuum seals to last months. She can\u2019t afford her own and she claims she has to smoke for her mental health problems. She says if I cut off her access her sister will smoke her out anyway so I don\u2019t think that will work.\n\nWe have gotten in several arguments over this. I tell her I\u2019m a grown man, I pay bills, and I\u2019m not going to lose my job. Therefore, what I do in my free time shouldn\u2019t matter. I work 60 hours a week and it\u2019s how I unwind and recharge.

I was then asked to come back to the same position, but in a different \"market\" (new location) and started as a New Employee on December 14th. I was not able to be reactivated and had to go through as a new hire again, although they kept my old employment number. I'm a new employee on the books now.\n>\n\n> My first new commission checks in January show that the company is deducting money from earned commissions for some reason. After some research, it turns out they are penalizing me for projects/materials refunded while I was not an employee (July and October) from my previous location in the other market. Somehow, I don't think this is right. Any insight here is appreciated before I go to the powers at be with a case here. Are they allowed to do this?\n\n---\nLocationBot 4.973 29/273rds | [Report Issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/locationbot)"}, "turk_ratings": {"retrieval": {"is_preferred": false, "is_preferred_continuous": 0.0, "diagnostics": [{"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "neutral", "worker_id_anonymized": 1}, {"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "neutral", "worker_id_anonymized": 2}, {"q1_intensifier": 1, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "neutral", "worker_id_anonymized": 6}], "worker_ids_anonymized": [1, 2, 6]}, "grover-large": {"is_preferred": false, "is_preferred_continuous": 0.0, "diagnostics": [{"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "contradiction", "worker_id_anonymized": 0}, {"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "neutral", "worker_id_anonymized": 1}, {"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "neutral", "worker_id_anonymized": 4}], "worker_ids_anonymized": [0, 1, 4]}, "grover-mega": {"is_preferred": false, "is_preferred_continuous": 0.0, "diagnostics": [{"q1_intensifier": 1, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "contradiction", "worker_id_anonymized": 1}, {"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "contradiction", "worker_id_anonymized": 7}, {"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "neutral", "worker_id_anonymized": 15}], "worker_ids_anonymized": [1, 7, 15]}, "T5-3B": {"is_preferred": false, "is_preferred_continuous": 0.0, "diagnostics": [{"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "contradiction", "worker_id_anonymized": 0}, {"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "neutral", "worker_id_anonymized": 5}, {"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "helpful", "q3_justification": "writing", "worker_id_anonymized": 8}], "worker_ids_anonymized": [0, 5, 8]}, "T5-11B": {"is_preferred": true, "is_preferred_continuous": 1.0, "diagnostics": [{"q1_intensifier": 1, "q2_helpful_or_not": "helpful", "q3_justification": "meaning", "worker_id_anonymized": 6}, {"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "neutral", "worker_id_anonymized": 3}], "worker_ids_anonymized": [2, 6, 3]}, "second_best_reddit_advice": {"is_preferred": false, "is_preferred_continuous": 0.0, "diagnostics": [{"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "contradiction", "worker_id_anonymized": 0}, {"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "contradiction", "worker_id_anonymized": 2}, {"q1_intensifier": 2, "q2_helpful_or_not": "nothelpful", "q3_justification": "contradiction", "worker_id_anonymized": 3}], "worker_ids_anonymized": [0, 2, 3]}}}

We have 2 children,  ages 3yrs and 1.5 yrs old. My wife wants a 3rd and I don't - its causing some serious strife as we are both dead set in those feelings.\n\nFrom the beginning of our relationship we have always talked about the future, and been very open about what we each wanted. My wife always mentioned she wanted at least 2 kids, and possibly more. I always mentioned I did not have an ideal number but would want to take it one at a time rather than committing to a specific number.\n\nFast forward 10 years, we're married, have a house, well paying jobs and 2 amazing children I would move heaven and earth for. I knew the moment our second was born that I didn't want to go through the process again, I looked at it as a closed chapter in my life and looked forward to the challenges of raising these kids into contributing members of society as a team. My wife even made comments right after our seconds birth that she wasn't sure if she wanted to go through pregnancy again.\n\n1.5 years later she tells me she wants to start planning for a 3rd and asked how I felt. I was honest and told her it wasn't something I wanted to do, and that I was quite content and occupied with 2 kids. She immediately became upset, crying etc. She came back to the topic a couple days later and rather aggressively demanded reasons as to why I didn't want a 3rd. I explained that it wasn't something I want to do, ergo its something I do not want to do. Simple as that. I work a stressful job (as does she) and end up dropping off and picking up the kids from childcare and taking care of them solo most nights and weekends as she is a shift worker. In my deepest of deepest feelings the thought of managing 3 children at once gives me instant anxiety and negative vibes. I already feel as if splitting my attention between the 2 is not right, I'm still getting used to the idea of not having just one child I suppose. The thought of having another is just a full hard no in my soul. She feels being a mother is her calling (and she's right - she's an amazing mother) and wants to keep at it. I'm at the opposite end of the spectrum, I'm not nearly as confident and was never truly \"ready\" when it came to having kids - but am glad I did. I love being a father.\n\nThings got worse when we had a date night without the kids. She quickly opened the topic as we ate, I confirmed I still felt the same way as I did before, and was unlikely to change my mind. She was upset and told me \"I wish I knew this before we got married, I should have married a family man\". Then proceeded to tell me I have to compromise on 3 children because she actually wants 4! I kept my cool, told her bringing humans into the world is not something that should begin on a compromise, or from a parent without total commitment. She proceed to present an ultimatum thinly disguised as a suggestion. \"I'm not sure what this means for our relationship\". I ended the conversation by suggesting we go to see a counselor, she did not like the idea.\n\nI've never had such a hard time in a relationship. It seems we're both dead set on our position. She's upset because she feels I hold all the power in the decision and that me saying no will cause her long term pain. She describes it as \"mourning the life she'll never have\".\n\nI'm finally in a place in my life where I have the confidence to say how I feel, I was raised a pleaser and generally never rocked the boat or would cave quickly to pressure. I'm unwilling to do something that will potentially impede the relationship I have with my current kids (adding a 3rd and being resentful) and the relationship I have with my wife (resenting her for wanting a 3rd). And I am also fully aware that I am essentially asking her to do something that may make her feel equally resentful to me.\n\nI could understand her level of frustration and anger if I had told her we're not having kids right after we got married.

We currently live on his dad\u2019s farm and he works there too. I\u2019m a nanny and study part time.\n\nFor some context, I\u2019m pretty petite (5\u20192) and have a small frame. However my boobs are too big and I always struggled with it. I get shoulder and back pain, running/exercising isn\u2019t comfortable even with good sports bras and they get super sensitive during my period. I\u2019m happy with their appearance but it just isn\u2019t worth all these restrictions. There are other reasons too but I\u2019d say these are the main ones.\n\nA few months ago I researched online and learnt about breast reduction surgery. I\u2019m 100% interested in this and even started saving up for it. We want children and I read that surgeries of that nature can interfere with your ability to breastfeed so I\u2019m waiting until after then. That\u2019s the ONLY thing stopping me from getting the surgery done sooner.\n\nWhen I first told BF about my decision, he got really upset and said that it\u2019s a horrible idea. He said that it\u2019s unfair that I\u2019m taking something so important from him and that I should really think about it. I totally get that he\u2019s attracted to my body the way it is but I need to think about myself too. We had a bit of an argument where he said that I\u2019m breaking his heart, which imo is very dramatic.\n\nHe brought up the \u201cyou\u2019re too young, what about our kids etc\u201d argument. I explained that I will wait until AFTER we have babies because I want to breastfeed them, which means that it might be years into the future. I\u2019ll probably be late 20s/early 30s, I don\u2019t know. (Either way, I will get it done at some point) Even after mentioning all the health/ comfort reasons, he says that I\u2019m being kinda selfish. And he literally begged me not go through with it. Afterwards we made up but I could tell he was still feeling a bit emotional.\n\nWe have discussed this subject a few times now and he always says that he loves my boobs, doesn\u2019t want me to change etc. I understand where he\u2019s coming from but I think he needs to learn how to get over it. I\u2019m very attracted to his body and would be sad if he got anything changed but I can\u2019t even think of an equivalent. (He tried to say it\u2019s like him getting surgery to make his penis smaller but i don\u2019t think you can compare genitals to boobs). Besides, he\u2019s a bit immature when it comes to this topic. Sometimes he hugs me randomly or just buries his face in my chest and says that that he will \u201cmiss them\u201d. A few days ago he actually gave me a silly list of reasons why I shouldn\u2019t get a breast reduction.\n\nObviously I love this guy and want to spend the rest of eternity with him so I really want to fix this. We\u2019re getting engaged this year and I think it\u2019s best to come to an agreement ASAP. How should I/we approach this?

I'm really excited, except for the fact that he's not 100% comfortable with the room setup. Let me explain....\n\nMy dad (60) is extremely generous and has offered us the chance to go on vacation with him (something we couldn't afford by ourselves). Our flight is leaving super early in the morning so it makes sense to get a hotel close to the airport and stay the night before instead of waking up early to drive 2 hours to the airport. My dad went ahead a booked the room for 3. There will be 2 beds, one for him and one for my boyfriend (let's call him B) and I.\n\nSo B and I were raised very differently. His family is all about no sleeping in the same bed, no living in the same home, and no sex all before marriage. I grew up in a very open family so they know that B stays over often and we have sex often. He doesn't follow his family's way of thinking, however he's VERY respectful of his family's beliefs if we are all staying together. He's one of 5 kids so his family will get an air bnb for vacation and I'll have to stay in his sister's room.\n\nI'm an only child with divorced parents so my family has never been big enough to need an air bnb. Hotels have always been just fine. The point in explaining all this is to understand both B's opinion and my opinion.\n\nNow back to the actual problem. We were hanging out with his friends last night talking about vacation and our conversation went something like this:\n\nFriend: That's so exciting you're going on vacation!! But with your dad? What's the room setup like?\n\nB: We are all staying together, he's sleeping in the same bed.\n\nMe: He is NOT sleeping in the same bed! He got 2 separate beds for us and for him.....? And that's for ONE NIGHT while we stay close to the airport for our flight. When we get to our actual destination, the hotel has one bed room for my father and B and I will sleep on the pull out couch in the living room.\n\nB: Well he may as well be sleeping with us...\n\nFriend: Ya, that's weird\n\nI never thought about it being weird! I understand B and I are older to be going on a family vacation and it's different when he's used to a family of 5. But with me, all I have is my dad. We are very close and open and he would have never invited us is he wasn't comfortable with it.\n\nB has brought up him being uncomfortable with the room setup from the beginning. But it's a destination we just can't afford by ourselves. It's honestly the chance of a lifetime so that's why he is going along with it. I just wish he wouldn't have announced it to his whole friend group that we were with. And it's double embarrassing that they also think this is weird.\n\nSorry this is so scatter brained. I'm mainly just embarrassed that his friends think this is gross and I feel a little disrespected that he would talk about my dad like that. But then again, I really do understand how he feels.\n\nHelp!\n\nTL;DR My boyfriend is uncomfortable sleeping on the couch with me while my dad sleeps in his own bedroom and has talked about this with his friends...

Her reaction just added to my shock. I brought Anna inside while she was yelling and cursing. We comforted her, gave her water and sugar when she told us what happened through tears. My wife was shushing her , telling her it was going to be okay.\n\nBut then she started saying things like \"you'll find someone better\" , \"he wasn't man enough anyway\" which disturbed me.

They often refer to each other as brother and sister, but I\u2019m still concerned. Pretty much they do a lot together, I guess before I was in the picture he would always go to her house (which is an hour drive and way out of the way) just to help her cook dinner. She was married, but they\u2019re in the process of signing divorce papers, which is why i\u2019ve grown more worry some. If we go out to eat, she\u2019s usually invited and comes alone. They always joke about things I don\u2019t understand like about work stuff and inside jokes and I sit there looking stupid and feeling invisible. We even went to like a vendor fair and she bought him a cup, but I wasn\u2019t offered anything.

I get that he\u2019s just a nice guy, but as he was explaining it, I realized he had this huge smile on his face, and that he barely did big things for me. And I cried. It\u2019s hurting me, I don\u2019t think he\u2019d ever do anything about her, but what should I do? Should I tell him I\u2019m worried about it or should I just suck it up, cause I also have guy best friends.

You're free to tell the police you're fine where you are, or that you would prefer not to be in contact with your parents. Most police departments have no interest in being in the middle of a family dispute and will close out a missing persons complaint once it's clear you're not \"missing\" in any meaningful sense.

A restraining order will not stop the police from investigating a welfare complaint long enough to at least knock on your door, either - it may give you the option of pursuing charges in response, but the police aren't covered and can't be expected to know that this is a family spat in advance.\n\nI will point out that it's unlikely that your parents will be _convinced_ by your reasons, whatever they are.

Please help!\n\nMy (37M) mother (72F) died in January without a legal will. Her condo is now in the probate process with me named as the \"personal representative of the estate.\" My sister (39F) has a borderline personality disorder, bipolar, malignant narcissism, take your pick. She has been diagnosed with all of them. I had no contact with her for about two years after she lost all custody and even supervision of her son and was formerly evicted from my father's (72M) home, who she was elder abusing to the point where he had to move out or was going to be consumed by depression.\n\nMy wife and I handled everything quickly and kept my mother's funeral small because of my sister. We had difficulty even contacting her, and we had to go through her former social worker and the half-way house where she lives now. Also, another tragedy is my sister has the right credentials to keep getting teaching jobs at these garbage charter schools in Michigan who can't talk to each other because of HIPAA rules. I blame Betsy DeVos for that. She will get a job until she does something to get fired and then picks up another one almost immediately. She's also been in rehab for 15+ years but has been kicked out of the AA/NA community for targeting and exploiting people as well as harassing them online. Trust me when I say she is an absolute toxic monster who I need out of my life again, except now I own a condo with her 50/50. My mother was also a hoarder so it's going to be a big effort to clean everything out and get it sold.\n\nSince the funeral, my sister posted selfies to social media she took with the casket she insisted get opened. My wife and I tried our best to persuade her to take them down. Up until this point, she was still liking us since we wired her gas money and paid for her hotel stay. However, this turned things adversarial immediately, and she started up with extortion attempts as well as trying to embarrass us online. None of this is new to us so we've just been collecting this potential criminal evidence not responding to any of her antics.\n\nAnyways, we plan to do a remembrance ceremony in April around my mother's birthday on Earthday, but now I'm thinking I don't tell my sister any of the details. I'm certainly not helping her get down to Florida again. I'm struggling to focus at work, and I feel like I cannot properly grieve until my sister is again out of my life.My mother was also being financially exploited and abused by my sister until my mother cut off all contact about two years ago. This past year has been an ongoing crisis where she bounced between the hospital and assisted living as well as recovery periods living near me. I set her up at two assisted living facilities, but she insisted on going back to living on her own. Our guardianship petition failed because she displayed a lot of same manipulation tactics that my sister gets away with. Ultimately she fell and died in her home two days after I had the state social services do a wellness check.\n\nSuffice it to say, I'm nearly at the end of my rope in terms of ability to deal with any of this. We have a great probate attorney, and I've already got a Realtor ready to sell the condo. I just have to get it emptied, and it will sell quickly since it's in a desirable area. After all is said and done, there will be about $20k to split between my sister and me.\n\nI will give it to her along with a full and proper accounting, but giving her any money is a bad move. I'm on really good terms with her ex-husband and her son my nephew (9M). I asked my former brother-in-law if he could have his lawyer talk to my probate lawyer and get this money garnished for her back child support. My mother would have wanted the money to go to support her grandson anyways. However, he said while she does owe plenty of back child support, he wants zero legal entanglements with her so he doesn't pursue it. He views her being in such arrears as a way to keep her away. He is though worried that if she does a lump sum of money she will hire a lawyer and pursue getting some visitation rights restored.\n\nAfter the latest round of garbage on social media from my sister trying to embarrass and control us, my wife, and I almost reached out to local law enforcement and/or the FBI to get a case going for her extortion attempts. I believe it's wired fraud and a felony since it's across state lines. Her text exactly to me and my wife separately was: \"I want all moms stuff shipped to me in Michigan and the condo completely gutted & upgraded by 2/14 with spending money for me in the kitchen drawer & a year rent paid at both of my properties.\" She then said she wants to turn the condo into a production studio as she sees herself as an Instagram star, rapper, business executive ... I can't keep up. I'm worried the police would say she's just mentally ill when they see \"Mom left me her book of spells in Florida.\"\n\nAt least one other person has gone to court and spent $30k to stop her online harassment and get a personal protective order filed against her. As far as I know she just ignores such things, and there doesn't seem to be any consequence.

I turned in the paperwork by hand because I knew the fax machine was accessible by all of HR, upper and lower management, about 20 other various employees, and could be peeked at by anyone having a discussion with HR, interviewing for a job, or having new hire orientation as they walked past it.\n\nBecause I did not want anyone at work knowing what the procedure was, I told everyone who asked why I was going on leave of absence that I was having a different, completely unrelated surgery. I did not post about it on social media aside from a glib remark that I survived surgery, and nobody who I told the actual nature of the procedure to knew then or knows now anyone related to my company.\n\nToday a coworker mentioned the procedure to me, and when I asked how he knew about it he told me that a lower-level manager that I never really got along with told him and a group of other people about it and proceeded to belittle me about it and my breakup with a same-sex partner the year before. In the intervening time he has said things to me that I thought were insensitive but did not seem to be malicious so much as a display of his lack of intelligence, and the comments did not give away that he knew the actual nature of my procedure. However, in light of this new information it seems like many of those things could have been covertly malicious. I do not have detailed records of these comments, like I would if I thought they were malicious before now.\n\nWhile this matter bears more investigation and questioning of people related before I take any other action, I would like to know:\n\n1. Is HR legally responsible for keeping information like this from members of management who do not need to know?\n2. Did HR violate any laws either through failing to safeguard my information from snooping, allowing this manager access to my FMLA paperwork, or actually telling him the contents of it?\n3. Does the manager revealing this information to other coworkers violate any privacy laws?\n4. Does the manager using this information to belittle me constitute harassment?

I don't want to get involved in a protracted legal battle with a company who can afford to throw ten thousand times as much money as I can at lawyers to draw it out until I get bankrupted. Should my questioning lead to any conclusive evidence that this all happened, I intend to report what I know to corporate HR and allow them to handle the matter internally. My company has particularly unreliable HR that's really good at the \"do as little as possible to keep from getting sued\" approach to HR.

I for the past 20 years I have been putting money into this account to the tune of about 15 thousand dollars. My mother who is manic at times but refuses to get help or take medication sent me a message the other day saying that \"oh by the way I drained the joint savings account to get by for the next few months, will refill when I can, probably at a different bank.\" I now live 2000 miles away from the closest branch of this bank, I attempted to contact them but I have only been passively using this account for 20 years I haven't touched the money in it in at least 15 years, I have a debit card but couldn't answer the questions necessary to get specific account info without going to the branch in person. I do know that the money is gone and I will travel to the bank in person by the end of the week, but I want to know what my recourse is.

I know about custodian accounts, but how can she still have access to the money after I turned 18. Is this legal or is it theft?\n\nMy second problem is again with my mom and this is more my fault as I have been actively aware of it, I've just been letting it slide. When I was 16 my mom opened a joint credit card with me, her idea not mine. She claimed that it was to establish my credit. I will admit to wracking up a significant balance on the card to which I have paid my mom off for more than twice over. However she has continued to maintain a maxed out balance on the card only paying a couple hundred every now and then only to max it out again she has been doing this for last 10 years. It has caused my credit score to be low despite excellent credit and payment history with a number of other accounts. I have allowed this to go on because I was worried that card was the only reason she wasn't homeless. Now after the problem above I want to cut her off, maybe then she will be forced to get the help she needs. To that end I spoke with the bank, I was told that to close the account I would have to pay the balance in full another 12k. I'm willing to pay this balance but I cannot do it in full and if I start making payments she will simply max it out again. Is there anything that I can do to get out from under her.
